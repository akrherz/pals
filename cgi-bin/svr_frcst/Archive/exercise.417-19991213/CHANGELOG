# This is the ChangeLog for the 417 Exercise

Version 1.01 ----RELEASED 12-6-99 --------------------------------
12-06-99:
	Completed className system, full implementation of DB system,
this is a release candidate. 

	Implemented the "classes" table, instructor_email is now using
in mailresults.  More implementation needs to be done in the future...

12-05-99:
	COMPLETE re-write of the database engine, hopefully all the
pieces are now in place for the addition of multiple classes.

	MT417 is now a sperate enity. With 417 being the naming
convention for basic activities.  This should now be fun...

	Classized the annotation function and moved it to the local 
functions file.  Completing the NYI from below...

12-03-99:
	Configured the ETA maps to appear correctly on the page...

	Changed the font size of the "Continue" button so that more
people can read it..	

	Changed the way that the snowfall question is asked at "noon",
this way a user can not select both 12 and 6 inch snows.  Also added a
reset button to this...

12-01-99:
	Moved svr_frcst.mk_help to functs.py, so that the ETA help
option is now included in the help.  Changed all subsequent scripts
calls to reflect this change.
	Added to the final report when the student started the 
exercise and when the student ended, so maybe to see if it was rushed.


11-30-99:
	Successfully implemented a className system into the code.  It
is now important to include the className variable when linking into
the exercise. [I need to incorperate comments yet.]
