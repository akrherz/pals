# This is the ChangeLog for the 417 Exercise
Version 1.04 ------------------------------------------------------
2-7-2000:
	Added new picts and changed the design bit, hopefully for the
better.


Version 1.03 ---------- 2-6-2000    --------------------------------
2-6-2000:
	Changed to using nowrad radar instead of NAT radar summaries.

2-4-2000:
	Changed the Header above the ETA data.

	Changed it so that if form.has_key("test") than no information
needs to be added. So that the test class does not need to be validated.

	Users going through the test exercise no longer need to answer
questions, if they want :)


Version 1.02 -----RELEASED 12-13-99 -------------------------------
12-12-99:
	Implemented the exercise.adv naming structure, now the 417
name is gone for good :)

	More error checking, nobody has a major quarrel with the design
so this will be a release candidate.

12-11-99:
	Massive overhaul of the format of the pages.  Got rid of
annoying, slow render boxes.  Yuck!!

	Added the "ClassName" value to the report that gets mailed 
out to the instructor.

	Fixed annoying reload of questions page problem.  Questions 
should not disappear from pages anymore...

	Fixed up the data scripts, ETA should be displayed correctly
and now looking for different Satelitte images...

12-07-99:
	Worked on getting the admin side of this exercise working,
so far, so good.  Works rather slick :)  The Weather Service should
only be a couple of days away.

	Massive cleaning and error checking.


Version 1.01 ----RELEASED 12-6-99 --------------------------------
12-06-99:
	Completed className system, full implementation of DB system,
this is a release candidate. 

	Implemented the "classes" table, instructor_email is now using
in mailresults.  More implementation needs to be done in the future...

12-05-99:
	COMPLETE re-write of the database engine, hopefully all the
pieces are now in place for the addition of multiple classes.

	MT417 is now a sperate enity. With 417 being the naming
convention for basic activities.  This should now be fun...

	Classized the annotation function and moved it to the local 
functions file.  Completing the NYI from below...

12-03-99:
	Configured the ETA maps to appear correctly on the page...

	Changed the font size of the "Continue" button so that more
people can read it..	

	Changed the way that the snowfall question is asked at "noon",
this way a user can not select both 12 and 6 inch snows.  Also added a
reset button to this...

12-01-99:
	Moved svr_frcst.mk_help to functs.py, so that the ETA help
option is now included in the help.  Changed all subsequent scripts
calls to reflect this change.
	Added to the final report when the student started the 
exercise and when the student ended, so maybe to see if it was rushed.


11-30-99:
	Successfully implemented a className system into the code.  It
is now important to include the className variable when linking into
the exercise. [I need to incorperate comments yet.]
