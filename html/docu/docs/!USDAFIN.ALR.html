</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><P>The project objectives were to :</P>
<P>&#9;<B><I>1) Complete the development of computer-assisted learning experiences in the introductory soil science and meteorology courses using ABC, a user-friendly, object-oriented authoring language developed at Iowa State University.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
</B></FONT><U><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE=4><P>Soil Science</P>
</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><P>The ABC program worked well in the development of the soil science course materials. The program gives students complete control over the audio-visual lessons. The ABC program resides on the hard drive and 






it pulls the appropriate lesson segments from a compact disk (CD) at the students command. The ABC program also allows the student access to a variety of study and review questions, drills, practice quizzes and remedial materials that accompany each lesso






n. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At this point the course is totally in a CD format and students come to the Soils Learning Center to study these lessons at their convince. A lab tutor is on duty at all times to provide assistance over any issue that confuses the students. Whenever a 






student finishes that week’s material they request a quiz from the lab tutor to measure and certify that they adequately understand the week’s objectives. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Some of the materials have been converted to a web-based format and are accessible to students outside of the lab. The technology of the web is not yet  adequate to handle our lesson structure nor can it handle some of the review materials. At this tim






e many of these materials do not come across the web at an adequate speed and with sufficient quality. Only the simplest programs are presently available. But as web technology improves more of our materials will be converted to a web format. </P>
</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE=4><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meteorology</P>
</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><P>The use of the ABC authoring language was reevaluated for the introductory meteorology course. Developments in web-based technologies allowed platform independent course products to be developed along with 






a redesign of the previous course structure. Significant accomplishments include the design and implementation of a web-based:</P>
<P>&#9;i) forecast exercise which allows students to test their understanding of weather processes in a real world activity</P>
<P>&#9;ii) course manager which grew out of the support for the forecast exercise</P>
<P>&#9;iii) introductory meteorology course materials including lecture materials</P>
<P>&#9;iv) cloud exercises</P>
<P>Each of these products has been tested in classroom conditions and will be discussed more fully below.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;<B><I>2) Offer a summer workshop that will provide hands-on experiences using and developing multimedia instructional delivery systems for faculty in two and four year institutions which have teaching programs in agricultural sciences.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><P>A summer workshop on Using Technology to Enhance Student Learning in Introductory Courses in Soil Science and Meteorology was held May 28-31, 1996 in the Soil Science Learning Center at Iowa State University and was attended by 23 from ISU, four  f






rom 2- and 4-year colleges  in Iowa and one from Alabama  A&amp;M. (see<a href="http://www.agron.
iastate.edu/~USDA/workshop.html">http://www.agron. iastate.edu/~USDA/workshop.html</a>
). This
workshop was designed to give hands-on experiences. The Soil Science Workshop was a day and a half session that provided exper
ience on the application of CD-Rom technology to enhance learning. This was  followed by a one day joint session on a web workshop, Learning on the Web. A summary of the comments from these sessions is included in the section <B>Workshop Responses</B>.</P

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A symposium (The First Annual Symposium on Methods and Tool for Improving Post-Secondary Education  Network Enhanced Learning: Vision 2000)
was held February 24, 1996 (see <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~wxintro/conf.html">http://www.public.iastate.edu/~wxintro/conf.html</a>
). Five off-campus faculty (Mary
 Marlino, Director of Educational Technology, U. S. Air Force Academy; Brian Heckman, Director of International Programs for COMET; Paul Ruscher, Associate chair at Florida State University; Mohan Ramamurthy, Professor of Atmospheric Science, University o






f Illinois; Perry Samson, Professor of Meteorology, University of Michigan) participated as a panel over the internet using CuSeeme technology. About 100 faculty from Iowa State University attended this symposium and interacted with the panel members. The






re were seven speakers from Iowa State whose presentations were also broadcast live over the internet using CuSeeme technology. Comments from attendees are included in the section <B>Symposium Comments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><P>&#9;<B><I>3) Develop a multimedia library of materials used in the introductory soil science and meteorology courses for general access (digitized and stored for FTP access over Internet).</P>
</B></I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A library of meteorology images has been produced for real-time weather products (see
<a
href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~yshsu/mt206/forecasting.html">http://www.public.iastate.edu/~yshsu/mt206/forecasting.html</a>
). There are also a library of general course materials for meteorology
introductory courses available at (<a
href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mt206/lectures/lectures.html">http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mt206/lectures/lectures.html</a>
).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The development of the image library for soil science has been delayed by the failure to find a format that gave equally high quality  visuals in the several formats (Windows, Mac, Unix) we were using. We have finally solved these problems and a soil s






cience video library is now being developed along with the development of the parallel soils courses described in section 5 below. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><P>A symposium was held February 24, 1996 to address issues associated with the emergence of the computer and the internet as teaching tools. Many developers are subject matter experts and only modestly familiar with educational psychology and assessm






ent techniques. Thus, this symposium was organized to convene educators across disciplines to share ideas, accomplishments, and challenges. Because the internet can be explored in a variety of modes, this symposium used CuSeeme  technology to facilitate p






articipation with educators who wished to join from their own institutions. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The symposium goals were to:</P>
<P>&#9;1) Bring together educators who are using new approaches to facilitate learning in their classrooms,</P>
<P>&#9;2) Use the internet to facilitate communication between disciplines and institutions,</P>
<P>&#9;3) Explore computer assisted learning (CAL) experiences which have improved the</P>
<P>learning process.</P>

<P>4. <U>Partnerships and Collaborative Ventures That Resulted</P>
</U><P>&nbsp;</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><P>An agreement is being explored with Alabama A and M to utilize the soil science materials developed in this program. The materials prepared for Iowa State students necessarily emphasize Iowa soil and Iowa c






onditions. In this cooperative project the materials will be modified to be more appropriate to students at Alabama A &amp; M as they study the soils, climate and crops of Alabama. </P>
<U><P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><P>We have also established agreements with the US Air Force Academy, the University of Northern Iowa and the University of Alabama Huntsville to test the meteorology course materials. Also, Skymath, an NSF funded pilot program to use meteorology to t






each middle school mathematics has plans to incorporate parts of the meteorology materials as a resource for this project. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE=4><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5. <U>Future Initiatives Planned as a Result of Project</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><P>In addition to the cooperative programs being developed that have been described above, the most exiting new avenue flows from the CD materials. An introductory soil science course covers three differen






t aspects of study. First students become acquainted with the basic scientific principles that are important to understanding soil science. These studies include such concepts as pH, microbial degradation, nutrient recycling and water holding capacity. Se






condly, students are taught to apply these principals to solve typical problems. These examples vary with the student’s interest area. For example,  crop production specialists need to know how to determine lime needs of a soil in units of tons per acre. 






A greenhouse manager, on the other hand, needs to determine lime needs in units of pounds per cubic yard of potting mix. And thirdly, there are those aspects of soil management that are unique to different areas of study. For example, an environmental sci






entist needs to understand the impact of various tillage tools on soil losses while an urban and regional planner needs to understand how soil properties influence the suitability of a soil for a septic tank filter field. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Traditionally, all students have taken the same course with a mix of principles and examples appropriate for the general make up of the class. But with the development of CD technology we are now able to tailor the course to meet the specific needs and






 interests of the different students in the class. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once the basic materials are developed it is not too difficult to prepare alternative lessons. The student can then tell the computer which area he/she is more interested in and the computer will pull together the appropriate lessons. The original cour






se was geared to the needs of students interested in field crop production. We are presently designing two parallel courses, one for horticulture students and a second for students in landscape architecture. We are laying the foundations to develop two ad






ditional courses, one aimed at foresters and the other toward students interesting in environmental science. </P>
<P>In each case the computer will pull together those segments that help the student to understand the scientific aspects of soils and combine them with examples the apply these principles to their specific interest area. Some segments will be the same fo






r all students, others will be only slightly modified while others will be totally different depending on the student’s interest area. </P>

<P>An example of the impact resulting from this workshop is the following testimony::</P>
<P>Dear Professor Yarger:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks for calling and for the congratulations.   I just received good</P>
<P>news for accepting our proposal by UNESCO.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am very grateful to you for inviting me to the last summer workshop</P>
<P>about using the Internet on instructing courses.  This workshop was very </P>
<P>helpful for me and opened the way for the success we are achieving now.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At the end of the last summer an idea about producing Calculus courses</P>
<P>on the Internet was initiated between IITAP/ISU and Suez Canal</P>
<P>University (SCU) in Egypt.  We as a team from IITAP/ISU and SCU</P>
<P>submitted last October a proposal to UNESCO to fund a project for</P>
<P>producing calculus courses in Arabic language on the Internet and CD.</P>
<P>The text will be in Arabic and the equations and figures will be in</P>
<P>English.  The proposed budget for the project is $ 512,000 for two</P>
<P>years.  This project will provide an effective tool for teaching</P>
<P>calculus courses which are essential for many disciplines.  It also open</P>
<P>the way for instructing other courses on the Internet.  </P>

<P>As budgets have become tighter it is no longer possible for every college and university to maintain the personnel and equipment needed to offer small groups of students access to every course they might be interested in. But cooperative efforts co

uld allow colleges and universities to specialize in a few areas of study and to offer their courses remotely to students anywhere. These projects give several models as to how these materials might be delivered. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These models will help other teachers as they prepare materials for distance learning. Their development will also force administrators to address and solve problems dealing with sharing of student fees, who actually awards the credit to the student an

<P>This is a cost intensive activity that requires instructor and teaching assistants to coordinate what to do, how to do it and how to evaluate it. The structured aspects suggest that it would be appropriate. However, there are no right answers in the as






signment, just  acceptable ways of expressing personal recollection, assessment, and conjecture. </P>

<P>To identify someone (probably a student) at UNI who will be able and willing to work as my web designer/manager. </P>
<P>I need to brainstorm ideas for Web based projects that take advantage of the technology. I find I am so steeped in the traditional ways of developing projects that I need to relearn </P>
<P>or open my creative side to project development. I also need TIME to spend on this Web course development. Perhaps an urgent need is to find grad students who are </P>
<P>interested in developing projects, etc. for the Web as part of their teaching requirement in our Ph.D. program!!! </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Concerning the soils course, my immediate need is to get Dr. Schafer to come over to Alabama A&amp;M University to see our laboratory setup and advise on how to duplicate (if possible) his wonderful set up he has at ISU.<U> </P>

<P>Good Show. Lots of over shoulder assistance. The Web template is great. You had lots of examples and you were practical. Everyone should have felt good. My only concern was my own schedule with both John's Part and Doug's. I had to be gone more than I 






wanted to. I expect to refer and call upon all of you. I also go to know new people. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Very well presented workshop. It introduced what is possible, and got people thinking about what they can and, more importantly, cannot do with web based instruction. The only drawback is that there will continue to be resistance to the web. This can e






ventually be overcome with education, but I fear that ISU will lag behind other institutions in its use of technology, and therefore lose out on some of the really bright individuals that are looking for a place to teach, and be taught. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As a media support staff for ISU I have attended or presented at dozens of similar educational workshops on campus and this one was by far the most exciting and interactive. I felt the participants truly participated in the program and discussion throu






gh out the workshop. Much of what I learned came from other participants comments. Presenters were open, honest and excited about their topics. The computer software and activities was well organized. Thanks for your hard work. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I really enjoyed this workshop. Thank you for allowing me to participate. Interacting with others has encouraged me to continue exploring this teaching concept. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It has been a successful workshop and I enjoyed it. Thank you all for making possible for me to attend. I look forward to a long and fruitful collaboration. </P>

<P>Thanks for the opportunity to participate in the conference over the weekend. I think that it was highly successful. There were a good number of staff in the audience and I think they got a good overview of projects on campus. I appreciated the opportu






nity to see CUCME technology in action. Congratulations on a job well done. </P>

<P>I just finished listening/watching the conference at ISU via CU-SeeMe. It was pretty interesting. All I did was download a copy of the CU-SeeMe program earlier in the week. Then, this morning, I connected to a site which served as a "mirror" for the co






nference proceedings. Everyone who had video transmission capability were automatically displayed on my screen in their own little box. I could also see a list of those people who had connected (and were listening/watching like I was) but weren't sending 






video (these people are called "lurkers").</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Actually, I never knew if anyone could tell I was connected since I can't send video/audio and never saw myself listed as one of the "lurkers". There is a capability to send and receive typed messages but no one ever responded to my request in that sen






se either. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One thing that was ironic was the following. At the site in Iowa, the presenters had all their material on computer (via powerpoint or Web access, etc.). The information was then projected up on a screen so that the people present could see it. Of cour






se, what was up on the screen didn't transmit very well over the video. Here I was, looking through my computer at a video projection of something that started out being in a computer. It would've been much better if there was no video at all (it would us






e less band width), store all the information at a computer site available via the internet and give oral directions about how to access it. Then I could see the information very clearly. One of the participants, Paul Ruscher at FSU, did just that - while






 the presenter was describing his web pages, Paul just followed him along (rather than trying to see what was going on through the video). I should've thought of that! Too bad.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I also experienced quite a few disconnections that, apparently, the other people did not experience. I suspect part of the problem was related to the hook up here at East Stroudsburg. However, one of the "mirrors" I was hooked up with (atm.geo.nsf.gov)






 stopped transmitting early on and I had to hook up with another. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Perhaps you can pass on these two comments to Doug Yarger. All in all, I found it much better than having to fly to ISU. Not because I don't want to be in Iowa but because of the time and money required. :)</P>
<P>---&gt; Bobby</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I think our Associate Dean Victor Nelson-Cisneros was very impressed with the idea and the technology. All of us were enlightened by the presenters and their topics. I feel video conferences like this can provide enhanced communication and make possibl






e some contacts that may never happen due to costly traveling. Mike's father, Professor Taber, said there are some great lectures in chemistry at CU Boulder that they often don't have the time to get to. However, with CUSee-Me it could be possible to brin






g these lectures to his classroom. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I think everything went well at our end technically speaking with just a few break-ups in sound late in the morning. I think the suggestions you made in your message sound good and should improve presentation at the remote sites. Also along those lines






 we could have Netscape with the slides of the presenter running in one window and the presenter in another window at our remote site. It would require someone here to follow the presenter's program in Netscape, but would afford better presentation at the






 remote site.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I wish to thank you both for getting CC involved in the first go around and we would be glad to host any conferences in the future. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks for the opportunity to present on the panel last Saturday. It was fun, informative, and my very first experience with that technology.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I would like to get a copy of the presentation "Can computers foster understanding?" I don't have the web address. If it's still up, can you send it to me; if not, would it be possible to ask you to fax a copy of the author's slides? I think that he ha






d some very interesting observations, and I'd like to share them with our faculty here. </P> <P>Thanks again,</P> <P>Mary</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>

tool that makes it easier for</P> <P>Iowa State teachers to put class assignments or tests on the World Wide Web.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Classnet,
developed by systems analyst Pete Boysen and graduate student Mark</P> <P>J. vanGorp, is an on-line tool that automates many of the administrative
tasks</P> <P>involved in Internet class activities. It provides an easy way for instructors</P> <P>to give and grade assignments and tests, manage
class lists, create on-line</P> <P>newsgroups for their classes and communicate with students, Boysen said.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Last semester,
professor Doug Yarger used an early version of Classnet to</P> <P>manage daily weather forecasting quizzes for 250 students enrolled in a</P>
<P>meteorology class. Yarger provided the quizzes and answers. Classnet managed</P> <P>the rest, accepting and grading assignments, providing a
grade summary for the</P> <P>professor and showing individual students their quiz scores and correct</P> <P>answers.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Classnet
also can be used to distribute surveys and collect data via the Web,</P> <P>Boysen said. It serves the survey to participants and collects the raw
data.</P> <P>Although Classnet won't yet analyze the data, Boysen said he hopes that</P> <P>service may be added some day.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Classnet will be ready for use Sept. 1. "Those who wish to use the service</P> <P>should go to the Web site (<a
href="http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/">href="http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/</a> ).</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Instructors can do everything -- apply for
Classnet privileges, develop</P> <P>assignments or surveys and set up class lists -- on line, Boysen said.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> </FONT><B><I><FONT

<P>* From: Jim Perry &lt;jperry@FORESTRY.Umn.EDU&gt;</P> <P>Subject: Meteorology Class</P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Doug</P> <P> <P>Welcome back. I have
made some progress on the design for my Fall Quarter class. Classes start 26 September. The rest of this message is an unformatted copy of the
Syllabus. In it, I suggest that they are going to use your Web site. I have two question s:  <P>a) Can we really do that? b) Is there a time I
could visit for a day to discuss exactly how my students might do this fall and how we might work together in the future? I'd have to visit before
24 September, and as much before as possible to make it mo st useful this fall.  <P>Thanks for your collaboration</P> <P>JIM <P> <P>As someone who
strongly believes in using up-to-date technology to reach out-of-department students, I was intrigued with your 206 Home Page. I am completing a
similar course (our 301) here this semester, and while I have enjoyed it, I have fallen shor t of what you have been able to do, mainly because I
started using the html manual too late in the semester.  <P> <P>I was most impressed with the up-to-the-minute graphics that are available to your
students.  At 1330 GMT today 2 May the minimum temperature map up to 1200 GMT 2 May was already scanned and on the home page.  So was the 12 Z
surface map and also the s atellite pictures.  I like the forecast form for the way it seeks reasons for the forecast; that adds to the learning
experience.  <P> <P>One comment and one question.  I believe that you can find sources on the net which would give more detailed surface charts (or
when the difax comes back you could scan in what's needed I guess).  The question is whether you enlist TA assistance to upd ate the information,
whether you are able to automate it at all, or whether you do it yourself.  (My limited experience in just putting text on the page is that the
30-60 minutes of editing, plus interruptions, means that what I do is often a few days old.  If you want to see the plain vanilla exam preparation
I did last night, [book ref is to Ahrens] look at (<a
