<FONT SIZE=4><P>Identification And Significance Of The Problem</P>
</FONT><P>(I) <U>Impact</P>
</U><P>a. Instructional Problem and Targeted Need Areas</P>
</B><P>&#9;The use of multimedia software in education has attracted widespread attention because this technology allows richer, more varied and 
more dynamical means of presenting information. These appealing features are called a hidden danger by Schank et al. (1995) who point out that 
&quot;..<I>.pure information presentation fails as a technique for education for the same reason that the lecture method of teaching fails in 
grade school through college - students learn ‘inert knowledge’</I> (which is)<I> not connected to the situations in which that knowledge would be 
useful and so is ultimately forgotten</I>.&quot;</P>

<P>&#9;These educational researchers explain that multimedia applications must reflect how people learn. They note that natural human learning is 
characterized by four fundamental features. These characteristics of human learning are:</P><DIR>

<DIR>
<B><P>(1) Goal-directed</B> &quot;<I>People are both willing and able to learn while they are pursuing a goal of interest to them.</I>&quot;</P>
<B><P>(2) Failure-driven</B> &quot;<I>Mistakes are the triggers that people naturally use to recognize that knowledge is lacking and that learning needs to occur</I>.&quot;</P>
<B><P>(3) Case-based</B> &quot;<I>When confronted with a problem, people naturally think back to similar situations they have encountered that might help them solve the problem</I>.&quot;</P>
<B><P>(4) Tied to doing</B> &quot;<I>Learning-by-doing helps ensure that people will be able to use what they learn</I>.&quot;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;They stress that multimedia technology can enhance education and training software only in the context of interactive learning environments 
which are developed with the following considerations.</P><DIR>

<DIR>
<P>&quot;<I>Building<B><U> goal-directed</B></U> learning systems means creating engaging environments that engross students in their roles</I>.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Making software<B><U> failure-driven</B></U> means creating situations that allow the student to make mistakes</I>.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Making software<B><U> case-based</B></U> means giving students access to expert opinions and stories that are relevant to the problems at hand</I>.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;<B><I><U>Learning-by-doing</B></U> means building simulated environments and multimedia can make these environments more realistic</I>.&quot;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;The need for an integrated and motivating curriculum in introductory science courses is well known. Even the brightest students are often 
discouraged from pursuing a career in science. A recent national publication noted, <I>&quot;With so much 20th century progress having been fueled by
scientific achievements, some American leaders are genuinely concerned about running out of intellectual gas. Science has long driven the engines 
of industry, yet many American workers do not seem to understand  the very processes of scientific inquiry and invention that put them to work in the
first place.&quot;</I> (EOS, 1996). The National Science Education  Standards point toward a destination where changes  in classrooms will result in 
rote memorization being replaced by interactive learning, where &quot;follow the directions&quot;  and  &quot;listen to the teacher&quot; are 
replaced by self-directed  learning , problem solving, &quot;hands-on &quot; and &quot;minds-on&quot; activities. The challenges then are to design
learner-centered courses which promote problem solving, collaboration and communication skills, while at the same time being responsive to changing 
student demographics. To embrace the student of the next century we need to be responsive to student schedules, locations and job requirements and 
to enable them to participate in life long learning.</P>

<P>&#9;This proposal impacts two targeted need areas. We intend to employ a new paradigm for <B>curricula design and materials development </B>which 
uses interactive learning environments based on accepted pedagogy. We also propose to explore opportunities to better use <B>instructional 
delivery systems</B> for distributing web-based activities.</P>

<B><P>b. Project Background</B>&#9;</P>

<P>&#9;Both the introductory soil science and meteorology course at Iowa State University have addressed many of the issues defined above. 
The major course goal for the soil science course has been to enable students to take full control of their learning. In the past audio tapes and 
slides were the main communications vehicles. More recently these materials were restructured using ABC, a software product developed at Iowa State 
University to incorporate sound, slides, illustrations, video, text, animations and computer graphics. In addition, these new  materials allowed 
the student to be much more interactive so they could start, stop, back up, and jump to any part of the lesson at any time. The lesson materials 
were produced in CD ROM format and have proved to be valuable learning tools (Schafer, 1996). The next stage is to allow other students more 
control of the materials while still maintaining the student-centered concept. To accomplish this we propose extending these course designs 
to a web-based format. These new course goals are to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1) Allow each student to indicate their primary interest area (crop production, forestry, horticulture, environmental science, landscape 
architecture and urban planning). Then the applications of the soil principles presented will focus on problems they are more likely to encounter. </P>

<P>2) Provide students with a problem solving situation which requires integrating many of the principles learned in the course by providing a 
variety of problems that allow students to focus on issues more appropriate to their interest area. </P>

<P>3) Allow students to access these materials from remote sites. </P>

<P>4) Provide access for all students, whether present in our on-campus Learning Center or studying from a remote location, to hands-on learning 
experiences, to be able to participate in interactions with teachers and fellow students, and to write periodic reports that allow them to develop 
their communication skills.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;The original course focused on crop production. A course is being offered for the first time this spring for horticulture students. 
In the fall a course for landscape architecture students is scheduled. Within 2 years a course for environmental scientists will be ready. Courses 
emphasizing other interest areas are being discussed with teaching faculty in other departments. Agronomy students will continue to develop a 
farm plan for a client. This spring the horticulture class is developing an area for a variety of horticultural situations -- vegetable and fruit 
production, nursery crops, green houses, etc. Beginning this fall the landscape architecture students will develop a site of land for urban and 
recreational uses along with natural areas and greenbelts.</P>

<P>&#9; For meteorology course goals include:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>1) Actively engaging students by making prediction of weather events an underlying motivation for understanding course materials,</P>

<P>2) Using the forecast exercise for providing context for class materials and deepening student’s knowledge of underlying concepts and 
principles through application in an authentic activity,</P>

<P>3) Providing opportunities for students to develop confidence in their ability to understand and apply science.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The central course activity is an automated web-based weather forecasting exercise (Yarger and Boysen, 1994; Yarger et. al., 1995; 
Yarger et. al. 1996a,b; Yarger et. al., 1997). This exercise is a common thread for subject matter which serves as an entrance for other activities and 
provides opportunities for students to learn-by-doing. The selection and development of these &quot;other activities&quot; is critical if the
software constructed is to significantly aid student understanding and become used by other educators (Boysen, 1996).</P>

<P>&#9;Perkins et. al. (1995) support this view for how technology must be applied to effectively address learning issues in the educational 
enterprise.</P><DIR>

<DIR>

<I><P>&quot;Both practical classroom experience and ample educational research have shown that there are certain subject matters, and topics within
many subject matters, that are particularly troublesome, that confuse generation after generation of students, that befuddle some of the keenest
students, and that not uncommonly puzzle the very teachers who have the responsibility of cultivating students’ understanding of them. These topics
are our &quot;targets of difficulty&quot;... One of our most fundamental precepts is that technology is a tool to be used cautiously and selectively 
in education...With good pedagogy as the guiding goal, technologies can be employed selectively and sensitively to make a distinct contribution 
to teaching and learning...&quot; </P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>The products we have selected to develop for this proposal are those that support understanding of fundamental issues in soil science 
and meteorology. Consequently we anticipate that they will be widely used by the broader communities.</P>

<P>&#9;Another issue which we propose to address is the need to assist other educators who desire to develop their own products. We have several 
experiences to draw upon to help establish a practical, cost-effective mechanism for development support.</P>

<P>&#9;1) Dr. Peter Boysen, a senior associate on this project, teaches a senior-level computer science course (Computer-based Instructional Systems) 
in a format which closely resembles the requirements for a learner-controlled web-based development resource. The course description explains 
this format.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>In this course you will learn how to develop instructional software and articulate the issues involved in using the computer for 
instruction. This can only be achieved if you are actively engaged in lesson development. Therefore,</I><B> most of your instruction will consist of 
reading relevant documentation on the computer and completing assigned projects on your own</B><I>. There is no regularly scheduled</P>

<P>lecture. However, group sessions are scheduled when discussion would help in understanding the subject matter. </P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>&#9;2) A workshop, &quot;Using Technology to Enhance Learning in Introductory Earth and Agricultural Science Courses&quot; was held during 
the summer of 1996 by the co-PI’s of this proposal, Dr. Boysen and staff in the Soil Science Learning Center at Iowa State University (
<a href="http://www.agron.iastate.edu/~USDA/workshop.html">http://www.agron.iastate.edu/~USDA/workshop.html</a>). 
The purposes of this workshop were to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. To gain experience with the use of technology to enhance learning </P>
<P>2. To explore the use of technology to expand communication </P>
<P>3. To design pedagogically sound web-based course material</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>This workshop was based on experiences in soil science and meteorology in these areas. It was attended by 23 faculty from Iowa State University
and 5 faculty from other 2 and 4 year institutions. This workshop was designed to model pedagogical principles in course design. That is, it was 
web-based, learner controlled, with a significant component of learning-by-doing. </P>

<P>&#9;3) Drs. Yarger and Boysen have been invited to contribute to the design and support of a workshop this summer in Boulder, Colorado. This 
five-day workshop will demonstrate creative applications of satellite data for multi-media and computer-based teaching in atmospheric and
environmental sciences. The workshop will also include group discussions on specific aspects of instructional design, and computer-based activities 
for development of instructional resources related to meteorological satellite data.</P>

<B><P>c. Ongoing Activities</P></B>
<P>&#9;A Higher Education Challenge Grants Program project which was completed in September, 1996, (&quot;Resources For Enhanced Learning: 
Computer-Based Training, Lessons And Libraries&quot; Douglas N. Yarger, John W. Schafer, Jr.) provides an excellent base for the learner-centered 
web-based course development proposed here. Computer-assisted learning experiences using an object-oriented authoring language which gave students
complete control over audio-visual lessons was developed for the introductory soil science course.  The program resides on the computer hard drive and 
pulls the appropriate lesson segments from a compact disk (CD) at the student’s command. It allows the student access to a variety of study and
review questions, drills, practice quizzes and remedial materials that accompany each lesson (see Figures 1, 2; Appendix A). </P>

<P>&#9;At this time the course is totally in a CD format and students come to the Soils Learning Center to study these lessons at their convenience.
A lab tutor is on duty at all times to provide assistance over any issue that confuses the students.  Whenever a student finishes that week’s 
material they request a quiz from the lab tutor to measure and certify that they adequately understand the week’s objectives.</P>

<P>&#9;Some of the materials have been converted to a web-based format and are accessible to students outside of the lab
(see <a href="http://www.agron.iastate.edu/~soils/154/Homepage.htm">http://www.agron.iastate.edu/~soils/154/Homepage.htm</a>). 
Along with the CD-based materials, students participate in a weekly problem solving laboratory which culminates with each student developing a 
farm plan for a 640 acre site of land. While all materials reside on the CD’s, only the simplest programs have presently been adapted to a web-based
format. One purpose of this proposal is to capture the learning environments of the laboratory and student-centered audio-tutorial and make them 
widely accessible using the Internet.</P>

<P>&#9;Web-based technologies have been used to develop course materials for the past two years in the introductory meteorology course. Significant
accomplishments include (i) an automated forecast exercise which allows students to test their understanding of weather processes for over 1100
cities in the United States  
(<a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mt206/obs/fore_instr_exer.html">http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mt206/obs/fore_instr_exer.html</a>),
(ii) a web-based course manager, ClassNet (Van Gorp and Boysen, 1996) 
(<a href="http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/">http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/</a>)
which grew out of the support needs for the forecast exercise, (iii) cloud exercises 
(<a href="http://www.physics.iastate.edu/gcp/cloudlab/clab.html">http://www.physics.iastate.edu/gcp/cloudlab/clab.html</a>)
, and (iv) a pilot simulation of the weather associated with flow over a mountain called MountainSim (see Figure 3, Appendix A)
(<a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~yshsu/mtnsim/mtnsim1-1.html">http://www.public.iastate.edu/~yshsu/mtnsim/mtnsim1-1.html</a>).</P>

<P>&#9;These products have been developed to capture the characteristics associated with natural learning and are goal-directed, failure-driven,
case-based and tied to learning-by-doing. They are the first in a ensemble of products which are needed to restructure curricula appropriate to 
the needs of today’s students.</P>

<B><P>d. Project Significance</P>

</B><P>&#9;This project is significant for several reasons:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>• The redesign of the large lecture class has general applicability across all disciplines for improving student understanding.</P>
<P>• Simulations could be used in other disciplines. For example, MountainSim could be used in watershed studies and environmental science courses.</P>
<P>• The use of the Internet allows more flexibility to meet the special needs of nontraditional students. We can now be more responsive to the 
schedules, locations and job requirements of all students.</P>
<P>• The use of the Internet allows other instructors to select portions of course materials which best support their instructional needs so they 
may adapt them to their own learning environments.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;This project also fulfills several goals of Iowa State University’s Strategic Plan by strengthening undergraduate teaching through greater
emphasis on student-centered learning environments, employing innovative uses of information technology, emphasizing cooperative learning and
communication, and by developing critical thinking skills. It will also help establish national and international leadership in the integration and
effective use of information technology in the teaching of undergraduate courses.</P>

<P>&#9;The impact of this project is intended to extend well beyond the semesters students are enrolled in introductory soil science and meteorology
courses<I>.</I> There is a body of evidence (Thomas, 1996) that suggests that processes for understanding are themselves constructed. This means that
it is important to design web-based course materials that use learning environments which aid in the development of a students’ understanding 
as well as in the students’ development of understanding. One of the most apparent weaknesses of beginning students is their inability to learn
independently. Simulations which students use prior to lecture and collaborative efforts within the class framework provide ideal opportunities for
faculty to assist students in  developing critical learning skills. Experience with the authentic forecasting activity indicates that students gain
confidence and self-satisfaction throughout the course as they become more successful forecasters. The experiences encountered in forecasting
motivate and direct their learning activities in the rest of the course. This project will provide better opportunities to develop learning skills
and increase the level of understanding much earlier in courses. It is our belief that improving the students’ learning skills and self image as a
learner will have a significant influence on subsequent academic success and retention.</P>

<B><P> (II) Continuation Plans</P></B>

<P>&#9;The current Strategic Plan for the Department of Agronomy at Iowa State University pledges a commitment to undergraduate education.
Specifically, the five year plan calls for the development of more course materials to be offered via the Internet with a particular interest in  
making materials available to students in Iowa's Community Colleges. It is hoped that students attending a community college who intend to transfer
to Iowa State could take and receive credit for the course through a distance learning format. In this way when they transfer after two years they
will be as well  prepared for the higher level courses as students who began as freshman at Iowa State. Dr. Schafer is on a committee which is
spearheading this development and will be visiting several community colleges in Iowa this spring to lay the foundation for such a cooperative
effort. Both the meteorology and soils course are among those courses specifically targeted for this cooperative project.</P>

<P>&#9;The entire meteorology curriculum is currently under revision to adopt the new learning strategies outlined in this proposal. The skills
needed for graduates to successfully compete during their careers in a rapidly changing work environment dictate that we teach students how to
learn. The materials which are being developed and are the focus of this proposal are viewed by some educational developers as basic to the next
stage in the development of tools needed to  implement student-centered, interactive learning. Dr. Domenico, the program manager for the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) recently wrote (see Appendix C),</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>&quot;It's heartening to see Iowa State using the latest technology (Java especially) to develop a set of simulation programs for illustrating
fundamental processes in the geosciences. As I mentioned at the meeting, I am convinced that sort of simulation facility is the next qualitatively
different tool needed to move forward in making a complete set of such tools available to colleges implementing student-centered, interactive
learning. Our hope is that we can work together to develop a more complete set of such tools to complement the real time data access and display
systems that the Unidata community of 150 institutions is now using. In fact the sort of educational programs you are developing (based on
platform-independent Java technology) would most likely be of interest to an even broader range of institutions, including community colleges and
teacher-training universities.&quot;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>Discussions are presently in progress with UCAR and other agencies to coordinate the experiences in web-based course development at Iowa
State University with national programs to extend successful developments to other institutions.</P>

<B><P>(III) Innovation</P>
</B><P>&#9;The feasibility of making student-controlled simulations available using the Internet has recently become practical with the emergence of
Java technology. The web-based simulation, MountainSim, was developed using C and Java programming languages. The application of this type of
authentic learning environment in either  agriculture or the geosciences in a large-lecture class is thought to be one of the first, if not the
first, in the nation. </P>

<B><P>(IV) Products and Results</P>

</B><P>&#9;The products that will be produced will include:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1) Development of the present CD version of the soil science course in a web-based format.</P>
<P>2) Development of a computer-based authentic learning activity in soil science where students develop a site plan for the land use of their choice.</P>
<P>3) Additional simulations in meteorology to aid understanding of difficult concepts (e.g., gas laws, jet stream processes, etc.)</P>
<P>4) A web-based resource for instructors and developers which will provide access to products developed from this grant as well as the products
developed from previous USDA funding. This resource will be designed to assist in the construction of similar  Java simulations at other
institutions. It is anticipated that this web site will be ongoing and will eventually include products from other institutions. </P></DIR>

</DIR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>Overall Approach and Cooperative Linkages</P>
</FONT><P>(I) Proposed Approach</P>
<P>A. Project Objectives</P></B>
<P>&#9;We propose to use technology and researchers which presently exist at Iowa State University to address two targeted need areas: curricula
design and materials development and </P>

<P>instructional delivery systems. The objectives are to:</P>

<B><P>1.</B> <B>Develop web-based authentic learning environments for students in soil science and meteorology introductory courses which will serve
as a prototype of this new technology for general use in agricultural science.</P>
</B><P>&#9;There are several significant factors which will aid the accomplishment of this objective. Both the soil science and meteorology courses
have been under revision for the past four or five years to be exemplary educational models. The use of computer-assisted technologies and
simulations which engage students in learning-by-doing activities have been fundamental to these courses. Newly emerging technology has now made it
possible to adapt course materials previously designed for UNIX or Macintosh computer systems to be available in a platform independent mode using
the World-Wide Web (WWW). Further, the application of Java and other software has enabled the creation of motivationally engaging environments which
can be accessed using modest Internet transmission connections. This feature makes these products available to students in locations with modem
connections.</P>

<P>&#9;Dr. Peter Boysen has and will continue to actively assist the principle investigators in the design and implementation of these web-based
course materials. In addition, we intend to work closely with the Curriculum and Instruction Department in evaluating the use of these activities
for enhancing learning.</P>

<B><P>2.</B> <B>Construct a learner-controlled web-based resource to assist in the development of authentic learning environments patterned after
those developed from this proposal.</P>

</B><P>&#9;If significant progress is to be made in encouraging other faculty to explore the use of alternative methods of instruction to enhance
the quality, effectiveness and cost efficiency of education, it is necessary that resources are available so that faculty &quot;have help to help
themselves&quot;. We propose to provide this assistance in a cost effective format that has been demonstrated to be successful in similar
applications.</P>

<P>&#9;Two of these applications are already on the Internet. Dr. Boysen, a senior associate on this project, teaches a senior-level computer
science course (Computer-based Instructional Systems) in a format which closely resembles the requirements for a learner-controlled web-based
development resource. In this course students must  learn how to develop instructional software and articulate the issues involved in using the
computer for instruction. Most of their instruction consists of reading relevant documentation on the computer and completing assigned projects on
their own. There is no regularly scheduled lecture (see http://www.public.iastate.edu /~abc/cs403/syllabus.html).</P>

<P>&#9;The other resource is a workshop <I>(Using Technology to Enhance Learning in Introductory Earth and Agricultural Science Courses</I>) which
was held during the summer of 1996 by the co-PI’s of this proposal and Dr. Boysen. One of its goals was to help attendees learn how to design
pedagogically sound web-based course materials. This workshop was designed to model pedagogical principles in course design 
(see <a href="http://www.agron.iastate.edu /~USDA/workshop.html">http://www.agron.iastate.edu /~USDA/workshop.html</a>).</P>
<P>&#9;The outcome of this objective would include web-accessible materials derived from the experiences of this and other projects. In addition to
examples of web-based active learning products, this site would also provide opportunities for faculty to interact with the PI’s using email and
video conferencing.</P>

<B><P>B. Plan of Operation</P>

<P>(i) Procedures for Accomplishing Objectives</P>

<P>Objective 1 - Develop web-based authentic learning environments</P>
</B><P>&#9;Creating good authentic learning environments which serve effectively over a significant period of time is a difficult endeavor. We
propose to use situations which occur naturally in meteorology and soil science as a basis for these developments. In meteorology, the weather
presents an authentic environment which offers an endless series of multi-level forecasting problems. We plan to use weather forecasting to supply
the problems which invite further exploration as an entrance to a deeper understanding of principles and relationships.</P>

<P>&#9;The web-based forecasting exercise has been used for the first time during spring semester 1997. We will focus on the development of web-based
simulations, such as MountainSim, to engage students in activities which promote deeper understanding. To accomplish this we will build from
previous relationships between Drs. Yarger and Boysen. In particular we will direct graduate students in computer science who will assist in these
developments.</P>

<P>&#9;In soil science and related courses the site plans are authentic activities which will be used to engage students. For agronomy students an
activity will be developed whereby they develop farm plans for clients who have properties with a variety of site conditions. For horticulture
students the application will be to develop an area for multiple crop use; vegetables, fruits, nursery crops and greenhouses. Landscape architecture
students, forestry students and environmental science students will have similar activities designed around this same concept.</P>

<P>&#9;The procedure for accomplishing the development of these activities will be similar to that for meteorology. Drs. Schafer and Boysen will
coordinate the oversight of  graduate students who will participate in these developments.</P>

<B><P>Objective 2.</B> <B>Construct a learner-controlled web-based resource to assist in the development of authentic learning environments.</P></B>

<P>&#9;The procedure for accomplishing this objective involves several facets. The initial design of this resource will draw upon experiences from
Dr. Boysen’s Com Sci 403 course and also from the web-based portion of the 1996 summer workshop previously described. A key element must be added
which will facilitate interaction between the project personnel and developers elsewhere. In addition to the email and chat capabilities that have
already been incorporated within ClassNet, we intend to explore video conferencing and whiteboard software applications. This web-based resource
will be constructed to provide a site for public access to products developed at Iowa State University. We will also encourage other faculty to post
their web-based course products here also.</P>

<P>&#9;The basic design of this web-based resource site will be produced by Drs. Yarger, Schafer and Boysen. The actual construction will be done by
computer science graduate students under the direction of Dr. Boysen. The final support of this resource will be the responsibility of Drs. Yarger
and Schafer.</P>

<P>(II) Plan of Evaluation</P>

</B><P>&#9;Because evaluation is a critical phase of any project, we propose three types of evaluation.  Specifically this project will:</P>

<B><P>Conduct one or more "formative" evaluations</P>

</B><P>&#9;Experience gained by other developers of multimedia course materials, determined that the "formative evaluation" was one of the most
important phases of production (Heckman, 1992). We will provide the assessment team members with samples of simulations and course materials during
the project. Feedback from the team members will guide the modification of materials for a more effective product. Course evaluations from
meteorology and soils students will also be used to guide development.</P>

<B><P>Conduct a "summative" evaluation on finished product</P>

</B><P>&#9;The product produced by the end of the project will be evaluated by the assessment team members. Input from students will play an
important role in further development of lessons and materials.</P>

<B><P>Conduct a "discrepancy" evaluation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This evaluation component will be conducted by the Research Institute for Studies in Education (RISE) in the College of
Education at Iowa State University. The Discrepancy Evaluation Model of Steinmetz (1983) will provide the conceptual framework within which the
evaluation will be conducted. In Steinmetz's model, the role of the evaluator is to look for  discrepancies between what the client (in this case,
the researcher) intends to have occur in the program and what actually occurs. The evaluator's role is not to make judgments of worth, but rather to
provide discrepancy information to the client, who judges worth. Staff members in RISE will meet semiannually with the researchers to insure that
the study is progressing according to the plan outlined in the final agreement with USDA. Summaries of noted discrepancies will be shared with the
researchers. In addition, one of the evaluators will take on a more intensive role as an independent auditor to review and critique the materials
used by the researchers in the content development. An evaluation section written by RISE staff will be included in the final report submitted to
USDA by the researchers. This section will describe the progress to date as viewed by the evaluators, as well as the way in which the researcher
responded to any discrepancies that were noted in semiannual meetings. (Vitae for the evaluators are included in Appendix B)</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(III) Dissemination of Project Results</P>

</B><P>&#9;Dissemination is an important aspect of this project. In order to involve faculty in Objective 2, (The construction of a
learner-controlled web-based resource) it is essential that this resource is widely known. Thus presentations at national meetings, articles in
widely read journals and links with institutions which support similar educational goals will be aggressively pursued. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(IV) Partnerships and Collaborative Efforts</P>

</B><P>&#9;After attending the workshop held last May, Dr. Andrew Manu of Alabama A &amp; M, decided to develop a similar soils program for his
students. He has applied for a $200,000 grant to fund a Learning Center and the development of appropriate materials. As a co-collaborator in this
project Dr. Schafer will visit the Alabama campus in March of 1997 to establish a protocol which will allow Alabama A &amp; M to use and/or modify
the materials developed at Iowa State for use in their soils program. Another specific goal of this project is to make materials available to
students in Iowa's Community Colleges. Dr. Schafer is on a College of Agriculture committee which is cultivating this objective and will be visiting
several community colleges in Iowa this spring to lay the foundation for cooperative relationships. Both the meteorology and soils course are among
those courses specifically targeted for this cooperative project.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Dr. Yarger has an ongoing relationship with the Unidata Program Center of UCAR which supports U. S. universities with
programs in meteorology. UCAR scientists, Drs. Domenico and Marlino, will visit Iowa State this spring to explore ways <I>&quot;...to develop a more
complete set of such tools to complement the real time data access and display systems that the Unidata community of 150 institutions is now using.
In fact the sort of educational programs you are developing (based on platform-independent Java technology) would most likely be of interest to an
even broader range of institutions, including community colleges and teacher-training universities</I>&quot;(see Domenico, Appendix C).</P>

<B><P>(V) Institutional Objectives, Commitment and Resources</P>

</B><P>&#9;The Strategic Plan for the College of Agriculture Iowa State University ".... contains innovation and commitment to excellence to enable
the College of Agriculture to become the premier Land Grant College of Agriculture in the United States and around the world."  Included in this
plan are goals and strategies to further the development of an outstanding undergraduate program. In particular this plan challenges the college
to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>&quot;...provide teaching facilities and equipment and to assist faculty in obtaining outside funding that will allow our students access to
new learning technologies in their day-to-day learning activities, This is to include but not be limited to: (a) provide modern equipment and
adequate support staff for the development of both on-campus and distance learning teaching programs especially via Iowa's fiber optics network; (b)
encourage staff to develop materials using simulations, expert systems, interactive computer programs, video and CD-ROM technology; and (c) provide
the technical support and facilities to spread state-of-the-art learning experiences in classrooms and learning centers within the College of
Agriculture.&quot;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>In developing the program proposed here the Principal Investigators have access to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(1) The Soils Learning Center which includes 35 computers, plus a demonstration area, quizzing facilities and lab tutors to answer student
questions. As materials are developed for the soils course they will be tested in this facility.</P>

<P>(2) The Baker Multimedia Center of the Agronomy Department which contains a variety of equipment for capturing and digitizing audio and visual
material. They also maintain the large server on which the soils materials are located. This server will support access to these materials by
distance learning students.</P>

<P>(3) The Vincent network which is maintained by the university to assist in computer based learning. It's servers are the residence for the
meteorology materials. The Vincent facility in the Agronomy Building is but one of several dozen Vincent rooms on campus that allow both on- and
off-campus students access to meteorology materials.</P>

<P>(4) Iowa State's Computer Center which maintains several developmental laboratories devoted to educational activities. Dr. Pete Boysen operates
one of these laboratories and it will be available to the graduate students and investigators in this project.</P></DIR>
