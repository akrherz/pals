<dd><P>Suppose students attend class, take notes from the lecture, read
the
textbook and successfully answer questions like: _______ is the most
abundant gas in the atmosphere. Have these students learned science? Have
they learned to use science to make choices in their everyday lives?
Have they developed the skills to be life-long learners.  The answer is
clearly, NO.  Optimistically, students in this environment have learned
to read, listen and remember, but there is no indication or likelihood
that they have learned to think, solve problems, question, and
reorganization material for their own learning.</P></dd>

<dd><P>Yet, the scenario outlined above is the norm in introductory
science
courses at both the secondary and college level.  The best that can be 
said for these courses is that they don't cost much in terms of
institutional resources, including faculty effort.  The worst that can be
said is that they cost the individual and society a great deal by failing
to produce the levels of scientific literacy needed.  Changes must be
made.</P></dd>

<dd><P>A reasonable place to start toward making changes is to look at an
analysis of the current situation and its history.  Current instructional
methods were developed in harmony with the dominant theories of learning 
and the perception of societal needs that were appropriate for the
19<SUP>th</SUP> and early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.  The dominant theory
of learning during this period was behaviorism.  Behaviorists disregarded
mental processes, holding that "what you see is all there is."  As a
result, knowledge was seen as observable acts, such as recalling
definitions, applying formulas and reciting facts.  This led to lectures
and textbooks for transmitting information and objective tests for
measuring it.  Large lecture sections seemed to have resulted from the
desire of educational administrators to cut costs.  Our society survived
this fiasco because it proved to be adequate vocational preparation.
Many of the job opportunities were in industry where an employee learned
to perform a task and then performed that same task over and over day
after day.</P>
</DD><DD>
<P>Fortunately, times are changing.  It has been realized by some, at
least, that students were not learning much.  Students could correctly
select the quadratic formula from five choices, but were completely lost
if asked to develop an equation to which it could be applied. Leaders
have complained vigorously that graduates could not think or solve even
the simplest problems.  Thinking educators have rejected behaviorism as
an inadequate and disastrous theory of learning. The door was opened to
change introductory science courses.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>Learning theorists are moving from behaviorism to constructivism, a
belief that each individual must construct their own knowledge and cannot
receive it from others.  Constructivists hold that students must observe,
reflect and actively engage in the learning process.  For this to happen
effectively, the teacher's role must be shifted from dispensing knowledge
to helping the student develop the skills
required to construct knowledge.  In this scheme, lectures and textbooks
are of much lesser importance and authentic environments where the
student can explore and manipulate the phenomena are much more valuable.
The major challenge now is to develop cost-effective means by which large
numbers of students can engage in these active learning experiences.</P>
</DD><DD>

<a name="construct_top">
<P>Providing meaningful authentic sciences experiences for every student
and providing the individualized guidance required to maximize the gain
from these and future experiences has seemed like an impossible task.
Fortunately, two relatively recent developments provide some hope.  First
the theory of constructivism redefines the goals, encouraging a deeper
focus on learning to learn rather than merely memorizing content, and
second, technology has been developed to the state where practical
environments for doing science can be created.

</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Technology</H3>

<DD><P>An Iowa State University introductory meteorology class is being
restructured on the basis of constructivist principles. This has been
facilitated by World Wide Web server software that manages Internet class
activities <a href="http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/">ClassNet</a> (Van
Gorp and
Boysen, 1997). This allows every student to be an active participant in
learning activities with easy access to course materials, enhanced
communication with the instructor and with other students, rapid feedback
concerning assignment evaluations and exams and ready access to their
private records of course performance. Although the course enrollment is 
in the 300-350 range, ClassNet software enables ease of constructing,
distributing and evaluating assignments. The assignments involve
authentic activities (forecasting), simulated learning environments
(Java-based simulations) and more standard evaluations of content
understanding (short answer responses).</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>The course goals have shifted from the learning of science content to
also include learning how to learn science. The focus of the course is on
the understanding of weather phenomena, and the primary vehicles for
learning are simulations: an authentic forecasting activity where each
student routinely predicts weather events and supports their prediction
by identifying determining factors and an accompanying ensemble of
Java-based microworlds. Together these simulations provide opportunities
for students to be cast into the role of scientists. They take data,
attempt <a name="application_top">
to make sense of the data, seek to determine why it should happen
that way, put it into context by relating it to things they already know
and then interact with experts in order to resolve issues which they
can&#146;t explain.</P>
</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Application</H3>
<DD>

<P>The following segment of a course syllabus for a survey course in
meteorology (<a href="syllabus.JPG">Figure 1</a>) illustrates the
application of constructivism
principles where the focus is on learning to learn and the technology used
to create practical environments for doing science. The class period and
activities are designed to compliment each other.  An example of this
connection is the RadiationSim assignment (due by 11:59 A.M. (noon) on
January 20, 1999), the scheduled small group discussions during the class
period on Jan 20th and the series of archived forecast activities which
areassigned during the next four days. <a
href="#application">Link to Application</a></P>
</DD><DD>

<P>In this course two types of simulations are employed.  The concept
specific simulation, RadiationSim (<a href="RadSim.JPG">Figure 2</a>),
enables the student to
explore a
science concept before an explanation of the concept is given.  This
forces the student to apply scientific methods of learning in a simplified
environment where the instructor and peers can review and discuss the
learning strategies used.  The simulation "prepares" the student for
better and deeper understanding of the concept and provides the coaching
needed to improve their learning processes.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>RadiationSim is a simulation that provides an environment for students
to learn about radiation processes in the earth's atmosphere caused by
solar
and atmospheric radiation transfer. It has two instructional goals.
First,
it provides an environment in which beginning students can assume the role
of scientist.  Second, if students reason beyond the data collected, the
simulation raises some interesting "why" questions that lead to a much
deeper understanding of long and short wave radiation.  For these goals to
be met, the instructor must support the simulation by creating the proper
initial environment, emphasizing the process of scientific discovery, and
building higher level discussions on the student's RadiationSim
experience. In the <a
href="http://www.pals.iastate.edu/simulations/radiationsim/">simulation</a>,
students analyze temperature data measured by a balloon (radiosonde) that
they
"launch" both in the morning and evening over four types of terrain (sand,
plowed field, grass or fresh snow).  As the balloon is dragged and dropped
to various heights in the simulated atmosphere, the temperatures at these
altitudes are automatically plotted on a graph.  Several temperature
profiles may be plotted concurrently to compare differences before
clearing the graph. The students are asked to explore the various
temperature
profiles that can occur under different surface conditions and times of
day.  Then they answer questions designed to test their understanding of
the concepts experienced in the simulation.  Specifically, the questions
address the effects of ground cover, time of day and altitude on
temperature.  Students may use the simulation in any manner they feel
necessary in order to answer the questions.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>This simulation is the initial simulated activity the students
encounter in the ISU meteorology course.  It is also intended to be a
pre-lecture experience rather than a post-lecture practice assignment.
Experience has
shown that this is a new type of learning endeavor for most students and
much scaffolding needs to be provided.  The mechanics of the simulation
are
demonstrated and some global strategies are discussed.  It is most
important, however, that the teacher's role not usurp the critical
learning opportunities from the students.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>The weather forecasting activity is also considered to be a simulation
in which the students apply the meteorological concepts they are learning.
Prediction is a key goal of science and one which students eagerly
embrace.
They quickly realize that to improve their predictive skills they must
develop additional skills of observation, hypothesis-generation and
testing, and analysis. One goal for students in the introductory
meteorology course is to successfully forecast weather parameters for a
significant number of carefully selected cases. This is accomplished by
using a web-based weather forecasting exercise (<a
href="forecast.JPG">Figure 3</a>). This activity
is the common thread for the course and serves as an ever-present
opportunity
to apply course concepts in real-world contexts. In the context of this
discussion, the forecast exercise encourages students to apply the
radiation principles they discovered with RadiationSim to authentic
problems.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>Because the first part of the course addresses various factors that
affect the temperature of the atmosphere and the earth during the day and
night, the initial forecast activity is constructed to address the
simplest conditions - no clouds, no frontal activities and no advection.
Students are given opportunities to submit forecasts each day over a 4 or
5 day period which test their understanding of how temperature changes
from day to night and from one day to the next. An archive data set is
used to create this authentic environment for problem solving and for
allowing students to test their understanding and application of course
content.</P>
</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">The Class Period</H3>

<DD>
<P>Throughout the course the questions: "How do you know?" and "How did
you figure it out?" are asked repeatedly by both students and the
instructor.  The processes of doing science are emphasized heavily and
the profession of meteorologist is clearly exposed.  Students are pushed
to construct their own knowledge and given strong support in doing so.
This approach requires both adjustments in the learning process by
students and in the teaching style of the instructor.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>An example of the nature of the large survey course in meteorology is
shown in <a href="class.JPG">Figure 4</a>. These pictures were taken the
first day of class but
resemble any class period during the semester. Students are asked
questions during the period which are similar to those described
above.</P>
</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Partnerships To
Advance Learning In Science (PALS)</H3>

<DD><P>A collection of supporting materials that can be used to supplement
existing courses is available through a web resource called Partnerships
to Advance Learning in Science, 
<a href="http://www.pals.iastate.edu/">PALS</a>.
These materials include: 1) selected course materials, 2) an archive
developed from COMET animations, 3) examples of Java simulations, 4)
examples of forecast exercises and 5) an archive of annotated weather
data. This is a work in progress but it does provide a convenient way to
view some of the materials discussed in this paper.</P>
</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Summary</H3>

<DD><P>Teaching and learning in undergraduate science courses have changed
little during the memory of most in the university community. Now rapid
changes in technology has helped create an environment where radically
different approaches to involving students in learning are possible. Some
examples of the use of technology to actively engage students, even in a
large introductory course, have been presented. These represent works in
progress that are freely available for use by other faculty. </P>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Constructivism</H3>

<DD><P>Constructivist theory holds that learners must construct an internal
personal representation of knowledge. The richness and utility of this 
representation is dependent on the degree to which learners integrate new
knowledge with their existing knowledge base. This integration demands
the restructuring and change of existing knowledge. Since personal 
restructuring is required, knowledge cannot be transmitted. Rather, an
intellectually active learner striving to build a meaningful personal
representation of experience must construct it. The constructivist
learning setting is therefore rich and authentic since the context
becomes part of the constructed knowledge and serves to enhance the
utility of that knowledge, especially when applying it to new situations.
In this setting, complexity of the topic is maintained to the greatest
extent the learner's maturity permits. Complexity and authenticity
maintain the structure of the material to be learned and inherently
provide reasons for knowing. Collaborative learning, through which
students can share views and strategies, and thus develop multiple
perspectives, is encouraged in the constructivist environment. These
multiple perspectives provide learners with flexibility and support in
reorganizing their knowledge base and contribute to the toolkit of
strategies for organizing new experiences. A major goal of constructivist
learning is learning to learn, or metacognition, which prepares the
learner for life-long learning. Thus, much of the teacher's efforts are
directed toward developing skills and strategies for learning.
Collaborative learning within a complex learning environment provides
rich and varied opportunities for the developing and sharing of learning
skills (Yarger et al., 1998).</P>

</DD><DD>

<P>The key to learning is doing. Students remember things they&#146;ve
experienced, but doing something right once doesn&#146;t fix it in their
memory. They must be given opportunities to do it over and over again. In
fact, in realistic situations students will encounter events that they
won&#146;t understand. These situations are critical for deep
understanding. Learning involves the creation of explanations that are
used by individuals to understand the world around them. This occurs
every time one is confused. So confusion followed by explanation is a key
to learning. Thus failure or confusion is an essential factor in the
learning process. When failure occurs the student is ready to listen to
explanations by other persons if they can&#146;t provide an adequate one
themselves (Schank, 1998).</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>There are several key factors to creating an effective learning
environment. (1) A clear goal must be established. (2) Opportunities must
exist for students to play roles in realistic situations where they may
accomplish the goal. (3) Material to be learned must be available in
order to accomplish the goal. (4) Instruction must occur that provides
answers to students at the time they&#146;re needed by students to help
accomplish the goal or at the point where students become curious about
something (ibid.).</P>

required to apply their understanding in a series of archived forecast
activities during the next four days. Each of these three complimentary
activities will be discussed in more detail.</P>

</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Instructional Goals</H3>

<DD><P>The Radiation Balance Simulation has two instructional goals.  First,
it provides an environment in which beginning students can assume the
role of scientist.  Second, if students reason beyond the data collected,
the simulation raises some interesting "why" questions that lead to a
much deeper understanding of long and short wave radiation.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>For these goals to be met, the instructor must support the simulation
by creating the proper initial environment, emphasizing the process of
scientific discovery, and building higher level discussions on the
student's RadiationSim experience.</P>
</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Assigning RadiationSim</H3>

<DD><P>This simulation is the initial simulated activity the students
encounter in the ISU meteorology course.  It is also intended to be a
pre-lecture experience rather than a post-lecture practice assignment.
Experience has shown that this is a new type of learning endeavor for
most students and much scaffolding needs to be provided.  The mechanics
of the simulation are demonstrated and some global strategies are
discussed.  It is most important, however, that the teacher's role not
usurp the critical learning opportunities from the students.  The
teacher's role can be seen more clearly if the learning goals are
understood.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>During this initial simulation the students should begin to develop a
strong Problem Solving Strategy.  Most students are very weak in this
area and need considerable encouragement in developing this skill.  An
example of a Problem Solving Strategy that is the desired result from the
use of RadiationSim is:</P>

<DIR>
<P>1. Explore the simulation, identifying the inputs, outputs and goals.</P>
<P>2. Estimate and note the expected outcomes.</P>
<P>3. Develop a plan to test these expectations.</P>
<P>4. Collect sufficient data and record results.</P>
<P>5. Analyze and summarize the data.</P>
<P>6. Compare and contrast the results with the expected results.</P>
<P>7. Question the reasonableness of the results and seek explanations for them.</P>
<P>8. Rethink the process, identifying additional data that needs to be collected and important questions that need to be resolved.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DD><DD>

<P>With these expectations in mind, it is helpful that the teacher
demonstrate the simulation by showing how to activate it, set the
parameters, move the balloon, plot the points and read the graph.
Students can then be challenged to "become a meteorologist" and make
predictions about the relationships among ground cover, time of day,
altitude and temperature.  </P>
</DD><DD>

<P>Students are encouraged to develop a plan to test their expectations
and, after using the simulation, reach a conclusion about the accuracy of
their predictions.  At this point in the learning process, it is
important for students to develop their own strategy to test their
theories; the teacher presents the "ideal" Problem Solving Strategy only
after students have generated one of their own.</P>
</DD>


<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Post-Simulation Activity</H3>

<DD>
<P>Following students' use of the simulation students are assigned a
small group activity of sharing strategies used with the simulation
exercise and agreeing on a good strategy.  The teacher solicits
strategies from selected groups, outlines one or two good approaches and
discusses their merits.  During this time the steps in the Problem
Solving Strategy listed above can be presented and "methods" of
meteorology can be described.  Experience has shown that special
attention also needs to be given to interpretation of graphs and their
use to represent relationships of this type.  The use of symbolic
representation is a deficiency in many a student's knowledge base.</P>
</DD><DD>


<P>After the strategies have been covered, the results from the
simulation are shared.  Questions of reasonableness of the conclusions
and scientific basis for these phenomena are raised with the class.
Typical questions that may be  helpful in initiating discussion are
listed below.  These questions lead directly to a lecture on long and
short wave radiation and their roles in the temperature of the earth and
atmosphere.</P>
</DD>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Thought Questions for
Class or Group Discussion</H3>


<P>1. Of the four surfaces in RadiationSim (sand, plowed field, grass and snow), which one gets the hottest during the daytime?  The coldest?  Why?</P>
<P>2. How does temperature change with altitude?  How do the daytime air temperatures above each surface compare with nighttime?  How are they the same?  How are they different?  What causes the differences?</P>
<P>3. Focus on the temperature changes between 0 and 600 meters for all four surfaces.  As altitude increases in the daytime, what happens to the temperature?  What about nighttime? What causes nighttime temperatures to increase below 600 meters?</P>
<P>4. What makes the earth warm?</P>
<P>5. What happens to the sun's energy after it strikes the earth?  Where does it go?  Why doesn't the earth become progressively warmer with time?</P>
<P>6. If energy from the sun passes through the atmosphere on its way to the earth's surface, does this energy make the atmosphere as warm as the earth's surface?  Explain the reasons for your answer.</P>
<P>7. What change (if any) would there be in the average temperature of the earth's surface if there were no atmosphere?</P>

<H3><img src="ball.red.gif" align="top">Weather Forecast
Exercise</H3>


<DD><P>The weather forecasting activity is also considered to be a simulation
in which the students apply the meteorological concepts they are learning.
Prediction is a key goal of science and one which students eagerly
embrace.  They quickly realize that to improve their predictive skills
they must develop additional skills of observation, hypothesis-generation
and testing, and analysis. One goal for students in the introductory
meteorology course is to successfully forecast weather parameters for a
significant number of carefully selected cases. This is accomplished by
using a web-based weather forecasting exercise (<a
href="forecast.JPG">Figure 3</a>). This activity
is the common thread for the course and serves as an ever-present
opportunity to apply course concepts in real-world contexts. The forecast
exercise provides students repeated opportunities to test their
understanding of various weather processes in a forum that is:
<U>Goal-directed</U> (students are asked to predict various weather
parameters and select the appropriate physical reasons),
<U>Failure-driven</U> (for example, students now seek explanations for
advection and ask how to estimate its influence on temperature changes as
a necessary element in a successful forecast), <U>Case-based</U> (lecture
discussions of advection processes now have context), and
<U>learning-by-doing</U> (each student must forecast a minimum number of
times).</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>The forecast exercise requires that participants use available weather
products to predict weather parameters for near sunrise and noon the next
day. These times were selected to correspond to early morning (and thus
representative of nighttime conditions) and mid-day periods for cities
across the United States. Participants in the forecast exercise are also
required to provide supporting rationales for predictions of weather
parameters.  This raises the expectations from merely guessing values for
temperature, wind and precipitation to requiring students to ponder the
important factors which are responsible for changes in
these values from one period to the next.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>There are several versions of this activity that have been tested in
the large introductory meteorology course at Iowa State University. The
instructor can allow the participant to select any available city (from
more than 1200 in the United States) they desire to forecast weather
conditions for the following day or the instructor can specify a forecast
city.  </P>
</DD><DD>

<P>With the proliferation of weather oriented web sites it has become a
concern that a portion of the student population may &quot;mimic
forecasts&quot;, thus, providing motivation for the development of
archived sets of forecasting exercises. Although the initial incentive
for developing the archive version of the forecast exercise was to
maintain the integrity of forecasting in the face of &quot;web
answers&quot;, this version offers many other benefits for helping
students learn important principles in meteorology.</P>
</DD><DD>

<P>Weather most frequently doesn&#146;t happen in a timely manner to
illustrate current course topics. In fact, spring semester in Iowa has
largely winter conditions so students aren&#146;t exposed to forecasting
summer events. The use of archived weather data is the only way that
weather can be &quot;controlled&quot; so as to be coordinated with course
objectives. </P>
</DD><DD>

<P>Further, the <a
href="http://www.pals.iastate.edu/mteor/sample/forecast.html">forecast
exercise in its entirety</a> can be unnecessarily
overwhelming for students as they begin the course. The first part of the
course addresses various factors that affect the temperature of the
atmosphere and the earth during the day and night. The first forecast
might address the simplest conditions - no clouds, no frontal activities
and no advection. Students are given opportunities to submit forecasts
each day over a 4 or 5 day period which test their understanding of how
temperature changes from day to night and from one day to the next. An
archive data set is basic to creating this authentic environment for
problem solving and for allowing students to test their understanding and
application of course content. Later forecast exercises increase the
complexities by including days when clouds, fronts and advection processes
become important. </P>
</DD><DD>

<P>One important aid to learning is the outcomes assessment associated
with the forecasts that is provided by ClassNet. Students may access
ClassNet anytime from anywhere to submit forecasts; view forecast
verifications after the forecast period has passed and see current
scores. These automated outcomes assessments provide students with data
concerning the correct responses but in order to capitalize on the
learning opportunity that exists when students wish to <I> &quot;..listen
to explanations by other persons if they can&#146;t provide an adequate
one themselves&quot; </I>personal interaction is necessary. This can be
provided by either the instructor or a graduate student assisting in the
course through emails managed by ClassNet. </P>
