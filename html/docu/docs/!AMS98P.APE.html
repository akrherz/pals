<P>&#9;A major issue in the use of multimedia technology is to avoid replicating the problem which has persisted in much of the history of education, namely attention focused on presenting information rather than on understanding.  One means of assisting 


student understanding is to design multimedia applications which reflect the characteristics of natural human learning (Shank, 1995). We have employed Java software in the design of web-based authentic learning environments that also model natural learnin


g methods. The inquiry-driven simulations and management software materials which are discussed are based on several years of learner-centered course development in a meteorology.
<P>
<P>&#9;For the past four years a large lecture class in introductory meteorology at Iowa State University has been undergoing a restructuring where technology has been used selectively to engage students in the processes of science (Yarger et al. 1996). T


he focus of the course is on the understanding of weather phenomena and the central activity is repeated prediction of weather events at any of over 1100 sites in the United States. Students are expected to use authentic weather data from the World Wide W


eb to make forecasts and to provide physical rationales for these forecasts. ClassNet, the class management software developed by Van Gorp and Boysen (1997) grew out of a need to manage a web-based forecasting exercise for this large lecture-only introduc


tory meteorology class. ClassNet now supports more than 80 courses at Iowa State University and several other courses both nationally and internationally.
<P>
<P>&#9;The forecast exercise forms the framework around which the rest of the class is being organized. This exercise causes the students to ponder the essential questions of meteorology: What causes temperature to change? What controls the wind? What cau


ses precipitation?  Information which aids in the understanding of weather is still delivered by lecture and one-way media, but the learning of traditionally difficult concepts is being supported by the development of computer-based, student-directed, exp


loratory simulations. Thus, even though neither the course schedule nor enrollment are being changed, the effect is to provide inquiry-based experiences in a traditionally difficult learning environment.
<P>
<P>&#9;To help students understand the processes which are central to key concepts we use simulations to cause them to inquire more deeply into weather processes. The simulation of adiabatic processes was initially used Spring Semester of 1997.  This simu


lation was designed as a prelecture activity where students were expected to adjust humidity and temperature on the windward side of a mountain at the surface to cause either a temperature change at the corresponding elevation on the lee side or a cloud f


ormation at a specified height.  This simulation places students in situations where scientific inquiry is required. This is a novel experience for most of them. They are encouraged to try, fail, and try again. They need to experiment, analyze, conjecture


 and test as they construct fragments of science and scientific reasoning.  During class they are asked to communicate their experiences to others and to collectively seek explanations.  When their questions become more prevalent then their suggested answ


ers, a description of adiabatic processes is offered for their consideration.  An authentic weather prediction assignment involving air flow over a mountain followed.
<P>
<P>&#9;Another simulation which will be demonstrated is an activity involving a hot tub with a leak where students are asked to adjust the flow of water supply by controlling the faucets in order to make the water reach target levels. This activity is des


igned to address the concept of energy budgets although it has more general application.  Simulations involving other principles of  temperature change, precipitation development and wind are under development.
