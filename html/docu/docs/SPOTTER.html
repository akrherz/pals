</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><P>An important arm of the National 
Weather Service’s' (NWS) severe storm warning system is the network of 
skilled volunteer tornado spotters. These public citizens are trained by 
NWS personnel through training sessions held for cities within the region 
of the NWS’'s responsibility. In the case of the Des Moines office this
includes cities in 51 counties in the central region of the state of Iowa. 
A combination of training is conducted each spring for each county. Many of 
these sites now access to the Iowa Communication Network and training is 
done using these facilities. A much smaller number still receive training 
in person. Each training session lasts between one and two hours.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The materials that are used for the training sessions include movies and 
slides which are not available for the spotters for follow-up or review. 
We propose to use the present spotter training materials as a basis for 
preparing web-based materials that spotters could access to review and to
test their observing skills whenever they wish.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The web-based materials will be designed to implement pedagogically 
effective instructional strategies. Experience with these methods have been 
developed over the past three years at Iowa State University in the 
construction of a web-based introductory meteorology course (e.g., Yarger
et al. 1996; Use of Computer Technology to Restructure an Introductory 
Meteorology Course. Preprints, Fifth Symposium on Education, January 
28-February 2, 1996, Atlanta, GA, American Meteorology Society, 
Boston, MA J17-J20.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><I><P>2. Expected results</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P>The pilot project will mainly focus on (1) designing and constructing 
an appropriate home page, (2) scanning slides used in the spotter training 
course, (3) adding appropriate annotations and (4) designing self 
assessment methods. The web-materials will be field tested with several
spotter groups and the resulting feedback will contribute to improvements 
in the initial materials. We expect that these materials will be the 
basis for additional expansions to this pilot project that will aid similar 
spotter training needs in other NWS regions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because these materials will be available on the Internet an additional 
support option can be evaluated. Video conferencing has been used at 
Iowa State University in several modes. Frequent use is made of technology 
such as Cu-SeeMe for one-to-one interactions, but we have also expanded 
this technology to include participation between persons at sites in 
Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Colorado and Iowa simultaneously. This 
capability will soon be available using the Internet browser, Netscape, 
and thus allow inexpensive, "face-to-face" interaction between NWS
personnel and cooperative spotters anywhere there is Internet access and 
inexpensive video connectivity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The results of these web-based support initiatives will be better prepared 
severe weather spotters. This is expected to occur  as a result of being able 
to access spotter training materials prior to NWS instruction (a type of 
pre-lecture activity) and to review concepts at any time after the expert 
leaves ( a post-lecture activity). Further, this type of widely accessible 
material will also be an educational base for the general public. Subsequent 
versions could also be modified for use by K-12 classes when they are
studying their weather units.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><I><P>3. Development and testing</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P>The emphasis of this pilot project will be to develop a basic 
instructional design which will permit incorporation of spotter training 
materials currently used by NWS trainers into a web-based format and to also 
build upon appropriate pedagogical principles to facilitate learning. 
The first stage will require that selected spotter training materials be 
scanned and incorporated into HTML pages that are part of the overall 
project design. Experience with similar web-based instructional design efforts
has demonstrated the importance of field testing developed materials as soon 
as possible to facilitate the development of more effective versions. 
Thus, concerted efforts will be made to assist individuals in the spotter 
training programs in accessing and using these materials on the Internet. 
It will be important to provide one-on-one assistance for first time users 
to overcome computer phobia that is common with adults.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This pilot project will provide a framework for further enhancements and 
will serve as a benchmark with which to compare more advanced versions in 
terms of the effectiveness of the pedagogical design.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><I><P>4. Support required</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P>The main requirement is for labor costs to support:</P>
<P>&nbsp;(i)   design and construction of the basic web spotter training
product,</P>
<P>&nbsp;(ii)  scanning spotter training materials,</P>
<P>&nbsp;(iii) constructing HTML pages which incorporate digitized
materials
into an effective pedagogical learning instrument, and</P>
<P>&#9;(iv) evaluating the effectiveness of the web-based spotter training
materials.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Much of this work will be done by Tae-Koon Kim, an MS student in the 
ISU meteorology program. Tae-Koon has a BS degree in science education 
and has assisted in the development of similar instructional design 
projects. He has experience in both the application of multimedia technology 
and in the construction of WWW home pages.</P>
<P>The PI (D. Yarger) will work on this project at no cost to COMET. The 
services of the system administrator and the technical support facilities 
currently available in the Atmospheric Science program will also be a 
no-cost contribution from  ISU. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We do request reimbursement for a part of the out-of pocket expenses 
that we will incur (see Budget Details for specific items). Iowa State 
University has also consented not to assess indirect costs on the project. 
We prefer not to employ a formal cost-sharing arrangement because of the 
administrative record-keeping costs that this involves but the ISU 
contribution to the project will easily exceed COMET contributions. We will 
acknowledge COMET’s support of this project on the web pages that are 
produced.</P>
