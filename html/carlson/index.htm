<H4>Introduction:</H4>
<P>I have been fascinated with clouds for as long as I can remember. Having accumulated many cloud-shots over the years, it is time to share these
photos.  At this website, you will find the words are directed to the young, but the photos are intended for the enjoyment of all ages.  Families with
young children may want the parent to read the text.

<P>Some say that I have an over-active and vivid imagination, and maybe see things in the clouds that others miss.  In reality, I am just having fun.
As you look at these photos, I only ask that you relax, have fun, and let your imagination wander freely, and remove yourself temporarily from the
stress of the day.  Mother Nature provides us with a wealth of beauty, if we only take the time to look at it.  

<P>Direct your comments to <a href="mailto:richard@iastate.edu">richard@iastate.edu</a>.  If you enjoyed the photos, tell your friends.
<BR>These pages are hosted by <a

<P>I am indebted to my creator for showing these things to me.  The photos are dedicated to my family.
