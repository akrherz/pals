<TABLE WIDTH="650"><TR><TD colspan="2"><H3>A little fluffy dog named Casey Jean was a visitor in my home for many years.  She belonged to my youngest daughter, Stephanie, and was loved by all.  After running around the house, Casey would get tired and just flop in the middle of the living room floor on her tummy.  This photo reminds me of her taking a break before play time resumed.</H3></TD></TR>
