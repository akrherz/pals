<TABLE WIDTH="650"><TR><TD colspan="2"><H3>Here a poodle dog sits on its behind observing the sky and the many clouds that are floating by.  I bet he is looking to play some dog games with "Snoopy."  Others who look at this cloud have said that it reminds them of a very large "chocolate candy kiss" with a ribbon at the top.  Which do you see, or prefer?</H3></TD></TR>
