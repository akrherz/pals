<FONT SIZE="5">The dew point is the temperature at which the air must 
be cooled to produce condensation. The dew point effects how the air 
feels to you. If dew point readings are less than 50 degrees 
fahrenheit, the air will feel dry and comfortable. However, dew points 
in the 60's and 70's indicate an airmass with a lot of moisture. When 
forecasting for severe weather, you should look for dew points of at 
least 60 generally. During early spring and late fall, however, dew 
points may only need to be in the 50's for severe weather to occur.</FONT></P>
