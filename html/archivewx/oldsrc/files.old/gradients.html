<FONT SIZE="5">Temperature gradients are important for severe weather 
because they indicate where two different air masses are colliding. 
They are also a good sign that a front is in the area. A large 
temperature gradient indicates a strong front and the potential for 
severe weather.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">A good example of a large temperature gradient can be 
seen in New Mexico, through southeastern Colorado into Kansas, and up 
through central Nebraska. This would be an excellent area to look for 
severe weather on this day.</FONT></P>
