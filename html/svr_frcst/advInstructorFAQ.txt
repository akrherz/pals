-------> 1. Introduction

	The severe weather forecasting activity is a web-based exercise
developed at Iowa State University for use in a wide range of meteorology
classes.  This activity uses archived weather data, prepared questions and
responses, and just-in-time questions to teach the students important
meteorological concepts.  The exercise has been broken into three versions
based on the difficulty of the questions asked and topics covered.
	The advanced version of the exercise contains questions geared for
upper-level meteorology students.  Here is a listing of some of the
questions asked in the exercise.

-- From this initial data and the model forecasts, name a state where you
think severe weather may threaten on this day.

-- What role do you feel a cap will play in this event? (is there one, how
strong, where might it prevent convection)

-- Examine how 700 mb temperatures are changing upstream of Kansas City
(over the distance air might travel in 8 hours). What do these changes
indicate with respect to severe weather potential:

-- By this time of day, it can be important to look at satellite data or
surface observations to see if cloudcover is present in a severe weather
risk area. What impact could cloudcover in this case at this time have on
later severe weather:

-- Within a region that you feel could have severe weather, do you see any
areas where lingering cloudcover from earlier convective systems may
reduce the instability, making severe weather less likely?

-- What can you infer in this case from the moisture divergence plot at
this time, and over the last 2-3 hours:

-- If no storms have yet developed in the region you expect severe
weather, describe where you expect initiation to occur later, roughly what
time you´d expect it, and what mechanism you think will initiate it. If
your forecast is verifying OK, explain the main reasons you correctly
picked this state.

-- The evolution of the dew point field in a region of severe weather risk
can reveal important information about the atmosphere. Which statement is
true for this event:

-- If no storms have yet formed in your region, estimate a probability
that something will yet occur today in your area (if there are storms,
just answer "OK"). Justify your probability (if your probability is 50% or
more, explain why you still expect storms; if not, explain what you think
is going wrong).

	After these questions are asked during the exercise, the users are
given immediate responses.  The weather data can then be reviewed, if the
user desires; otherwise, the user continues on throughout the case.

-------> 2.  Setting up your class to use the activity

	The advanced version of the exercise is available for anybody to
work though, but the results of the user's work are not saved nor sent to
anyone.  If you would simply like your users to do the exercise for the
experience alone, a class does not need to be set up.  On the other hand,
if an instructor would like their students' results emailed to
them, he/she would need to set up a class.
	Setting up a class is easily accomplished with the on-line class
registration.  The URL is located at
http://www.pals.iastate.edu/svr_frcst/advInstructor.html .  The page
contains some of the same information presented in this document.  Once
you have reviewed the information, click on the link to create a class.  
The subsequent page presents a simple form to fill out.  Please fill out
the required fields and submit the form.  You may want to password protect
your exercise, so that only your students can access the exercise.  This
protection keeps others from running the exercise and then sending you
results of people not in your class.
	After submitting the form, a result page is generated, showing you
the values for your class.  It also has two links on the page, which show
you where you can modify the exercise and where users should go in order
to start the exercise.  You will want to write these URLs down for future
reference.

-------> 3.  Customizing the activity for your class

	In order for your users to use the exercise as members of your
class, you need to "release" cases for use by your class.  The PALS staff
has created a multitude of cases for use by your class.  These cases are
ready to be used by your class as soon as you release them.  Releasing
cases is easily done through the classAdmin webpages on the PALS server.  
The classAdmin pages can be found at
http://www.pals.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/severe2/classAdmin/index.py .  Once
you access this page, you are prompted for a password.  Enter your class
abreviation and password that you created in Step 2.  Once you have
successfully logged in, you will see a listing of options that can be used
to customize the exercise.

	[Create/Edit/Add Specific Questions] 
	This option allows you to add specific questions and answers to
any time in any of the cases.  For instance, if you wanted to add a
question about the 13Z moisture convergence plot at 13z 18 June 1998, you
could click on this option, select the case for 18 June 2000 and then
select the 13z time.  Then you will be presented with a form in which you can
enter a question, options, answers, and responses.  Once you have
submitted this form, the question will appear for your users in the
exercise.  You will recieve the results of this question in an email as
soon as your users finish the case.

	[Release/Revoke Cases] 
	This option allows your users to work through cases that you
release to them.  When the user starts the exercise, they are presented a
list of cases that they can work through.  In order for cases to appear in
this list, they need to released to them. Simply fallow the instructions
and populate the right hand column with cases you wish them to work
through.

	[Edit Hourly Annonations] 
	This option allows the administrator to tweak the annonations that
appear throughout the case.  Sometimes the instructor will want to ask a
question whose answer may have been given away previously in one of the annonations.  
With this option, the administration can edit the annotations as they see fit.

-------> 4.  Pointing your students to the correct location

	In order for your users to log into the exercise under your class,
they need to be pointed to a specific location.  It is recomended that you
set up a link from one of your local webpages that points to the exercise on
the PALS server.  The URL to link to is given to you when you create the
class.  The other method is to give your users the URL and have them type
it in.

-------> 5.  FAQ

	-- The instructions are too long, give me the quick ones.

Go to http://www.pals.iastate.edu/svr_frcst/advInstructor.html and then
click on the link to "Create a Class."  Fill out the form for your class
and then write down the URLs given to you. Then log into classAdmin and
release a case for your class to use.  Then point your students to the
main page for the exercise, in which they can then work through cases you
have released.  Once they complete the case, you will be emailed their
results.  Done :)

	-- I cannot read the emails that are sent to me, when my students
complete the exercise.

If you indeed have this problem, email Daryl Herzmann at
akrherz@iastate.edu and tell him of your setup that is not allowing the
emails to be viewed.

	-- Is there anyway to turn off some of the questions that
automatically appear throughout the case?

Currently, I do not have a mechanism to do this. I will incorporate it 
into the exercise in the near future.

	-- I forgot my password for classAdmin.  Please help.

Just email Daryl Herzmann at akrherz@iastate.edu and I will send it to
you.

	-- How tight is security / authentification for the exercise?

Security is not a major concern to this exercise, yet.  Your information
is safe on the PALS server and your email will not be given out.

	-- What should I do about grading this exercise?

Currently, we recommend that you just give your students credit for
working each case in the exercise and then grading their text responses.  
The exercise is meant as a learning tool for the students and not
neccessarily as a quiz.  The best use of the results may be to influence
what material is reviewed or emphasized in lectures.
