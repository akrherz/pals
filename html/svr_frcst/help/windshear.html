<FONT SIZE="5">Wind shear is the directional and speed change of wind 
with respect to height. This is a good variable to look at when 
predicting tornadic activity. If there is a lot of directional change 
with height, it means the atmosphere has a lot of spin (vorticity) and 
tornadic activity is possible. A good example of this would be if the 
wind direction at the surface was southerly, but at 500 mb the wind 
direction was westerly. A good example of wind speed differential would 
be about 30 mph. </FONT></P>
