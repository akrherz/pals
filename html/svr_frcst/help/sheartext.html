The SKEW T map below shows a good example of good wind shear needed for
severe weather.  Wind shear of at least 30 degrees from the
surface to 850 mb is considered good wind shear.  Notice that the winds veer with height giving
storms the
potential for rotation.  Rotating storms are the most dangerous storms and
can produce tornadoes.  Speed shear is also an important variable for severe
weather.  An increase in wind speeds from the surface to the upper levels of at
least 20 knots will aid severe weather possibilities.
