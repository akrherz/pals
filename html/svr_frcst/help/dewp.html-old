    What is a good dew point level for severe weather?
    <LI>
    <B>For severe weather, dew points of 60s and 70s are generally good 
    values to look for in the Summer. During the Spring, dew point values 
    can be in the 50s and 60s.</B>
    <LI>

    <LI>
    What does it mean when there is a sharp change in dew point values? For 
    example, dew point levels are 65 degrees in central Texas, but only 45 
    in west Texas and New Mexico.
    <LI>
    <B>When there is a sharp change in dew point levels close to each 
    other, it means there is either a cold front or a dryline causing the 
    gradient. This is a good thing to look for when predicting severe 
    weather, as storms tend to form along fronts and drylines. A dryline is 
    just a boundary separating dry air from moist air.</B>

    <LI>
    What does it mean when the winds are from the south on the dew point 
    map?
    <LI>
    <B>When winds are pointing from the south, it means moisture is 
    advecting up from the Gulf of Mexico and dew points should begin to 
    rise. </B>
    <LI>

    <LI>
    What does it mean when the winds are from the north on the dew point 
    map?
    <LI>
    <B>When winds are pointing from the north, it means dry air is 
    moving into the region and dew points may decrease.</B>
