<FONT SIZE="4">This product is one of many graphical products used in 
meteorology. The surface map is created to show the general pattern of 
the weather occuring across the country at a certain time. As the name 
would lend itself to, a surface map shows what is going on at the 
surface (ground level). On a surface map many things are plotted and 
displayed.</FONT></P>

    The watches that are shown on this surface map are either of the severe 
    thunderstorm or tornado variety. The way to tell the two apart on the 
    map is to look for the <I>leading letter</I> in the first line of 
    code in the watch box. If the leading letter is a<B> S</B>, then 
    you are dealing with a severe thunderstorm watch. If the leading letter 
    is a <B>T</B>, then what you have is a tornado watch.

    Here is an example of a watch on the surface map. This is a severe 
    thunderstorm watch, note the S, issued for northern Wyoming and 
    southern Montana until 4Z (11 PM CDT).
