<DD>By 18z, there are scattered showers in the northcentral plains and
the West coast. In the southern plains, there are showers and 
thunderstorms moving into Missouri Due to a warm front spanning from
Texas to a low pressure system in Colorado. Ahead of this front, we have
warm moist air being pumped in from the Gulf. We also have a
low pressure system moving into the west coast. The eastern US is
dominated by high pressure from the Ohio valley, eastward. </DD>

<DD>Showers and thunderstorms in the South Central plains ahead of a
warm front stretching from Louisiana to northwest Kansas. Showers in
the great lakes region. High pressure continues to dominate the eastern 
US. There is also a cold front moving into the Southwest. Storms broke 
out over night in Iowa.</DD>

<DD>Today high pressure dominated the country west
of the Rockies. A Low pressure system in Colorado  was in control of the
weather throughout the Midwest with a Cold front extending from
Montana through Wyoming and into Colorado then going south through
Arizona and Texas. Temperatures behind this front were generally in the
50's into the 60's. Ahead of this front, was a very tight dew point
gradient that is contributing to the formation of possibly severe
thunderstorms.  A Cold front also extended from the Low pressure
in Colorado through Nebraska, Iowa, and up through Minnesota with a tight
temperature gradient through the same states with severe thunderstorms
moving along this front that produced tornadoes in western Nebraska. A
warm front also extended from this Low pressure system through southern
Nebraska, central Iowa, Illinois and Ohio. Except for a line of showers
through Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia, high pressure and warm air
dominated the East.</DD> 
<BR> 
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>May 18, 2000</B></DT> 
<DD>High pressure dominated the West
today with temperatures in the 60's in the North and 80's 
in the South. A low pressure system controlled the
weather in the Midwest with a cold front extending from
Iowa to Texas. Ahead of this front there were scattered
showers and moderate thunderstorms. A stationary front
extended from Iowa through the Great lakes and along the  
U.S. Candadian border. At the intersection of these two
fronts in Iowa, there were thunderstorms some severe and
a few possible tornadoes as the low progressed to the
East.  There were also thunderstorms along the stationary 
front alon the Great Lakes. Temperatures in the South
were in the 80's while 50's and 60's were the
temperatures throughout the rest of the country.</DD>

<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>May 19, 2000</B></DT> 
<DD>60 and 70 degree temperatures are dominating the Central Plains and the West
with some 80's and 90's in the Southwest. The weather in the eastern half of the
U.S. was controlled by a low pressure system in the Ohio River Valley with
showers and storms along a stationary front ahead of the low. North of
the front are 50 degree temperatures and south of the front are warm moist air
being advected north due to the southerly flow. A line of thunderstorms
extending from Texas to Virginia made its
way across the southeastern quarter of the U.S. producing rain, hail, and
damaging winds.</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>May 20, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>High pressure dominated the country today except for a weak low pressure
system in the Southwest. The Northeast saw 70's while the extreme Southwest
saw 90's and a few 100's. The West experienced dew points in the 20's and 30's. 
The central U.S. saw 60's and 70's while the Northeast was a bit cooler with 50's 
and 60's due to some cloud cover and cool air advection. The Southeast saw 
temperatures in the upper 70's and lower 80's. The Northcentral Plains had
dewpointsin the 40's and 50's that extend into the Northeast while the
Southcentral Plains and the Southeast experienced dew points in the 60's. Rain
fell in the Plains and the East.</DD>

<DD>High pressure continues to dominate the country except for a weak low
pressure system in the Southwest and another in the Southeast. Temperatures in
the West are in the 80's to 100's along the West Coast and Desert Southwest with 70's in the
Rockies. Dew points in the West ranged from 25 degrees to 55 degrees.
The Midwest and the Southeast had upper 70's and 80's with
some severe thunderstorms in Missouri and Georgia. Dew points in the Northern plains were in the 40's and 50's while the
southwest had dewpoints in the 60's. The Northeast saw upper 50's and 60's for
temperatures with dewpoints in the 50's.</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>May 22, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>Temperatures in the southern half of the U.S. were in the 80's with 90's and
100's in the Southwest. Dew point readings west of the Rockies are in the 30's
to 40's. The southcentral U.S. and the Southeast have dewpoints in the 60's. The
Northern half of the country have temperatures in the lower 60's with 50's in
the Northeast. Dew points in the Midwest and the Northeast are in the 50's and 60's. There is a low pressure system on the border of
North Dakota and Canada that is producing some precipitation in the northern
Midwest. There is also a low pressure system in Wisconsin with a dry line
extending to the southwest causing showers in the Great Lakes region.  A low pressure system on the East coast with a stationary front
extending south along the coast is producing showers and thunderstorms in the
upper Northeast and a line of storms along the stationary front from 
Virginia through Florida.<DD>

<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>May 23, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>High pressure is dominating the northwestern U.S. with temperatures in the
60's and dew points in the mid 30's to mid 40's. The Southwest is also dominated
by high pressure with temperatures in the 90's and 100's and dewpoints in the
30's. The weather in the northern Plains is being affected by a low pressure
system with temperatures in the 70's. However, there is no precipitation because
there are dew points in the lower 40's. The central Plains are seeing
temperatures in the 60's and scattered light showers. The southern Plains have
high pressure with temperatures in the 80's and 90's and dew points in the 70's.
Severe thunderstorms have been making their way across the Ohio River valley
with some dropping large hail and developing a few tornadoes in Kentucky and
Tennessee. Temperatures in this area and the Northeast are in the 60's and 70's
with dew points in the 50's and 60's and other scattered showers and
thunderstorms in the Northeast. There was high pressure in the Southeast with

<DD>High pressure dominated the Northwest again with temperatures in the 70's
and 80's and dew points in the 40's.  High pressure also dominated the Southwest
with temperatures in the 90's and 100's and dew points in the 30's. Cool, dry
air is pushing its way into the north central Plains with temperatures in the
60's and dew points in the 20's to 30's. A low pressure system in the Oklahoma
and Texas panhandles controlled the weather in the southern Plains. Temperatures
in the 90's and 100's with high due points ahead of a dry line running through
Oklahoma and Texas contributed to severe thunderstorms and a few tornadoes. The
Northeast and Southeast will have to wait a few days.<DD>

<DT><IMG SRC="butoon.gif"><B>May 25, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>The extreme northwest was cloudy with some showers and thunderstorms
due to a low pressure system in Idaho with a stationary front observed
to the southwest and a cold front to the northeast. 60 and 70 degree
temperatures with dew points in the 30's to 50's were also reported in
the Northwest. The Southwest had mostly clear dry weather with
temperatures in the 80's and 90's and dew points in the 20's and 30's.
A stationary front running through New Mexico produced some rain and
storms today in the eastern section of the state. A cold front pushing
in from the north is affecting the weather in the Northern Plains and
Midwest causing a few showers and storms in Nebraska, but nothing too
severe at this time. Temperatures in the 60's and 70's with dew points
in the 30's and 40's were observed in the central Plains as well.
Temperatures in the 80's and 90's with dew points in the 70's are in the
southern Plains and the Southeast. A stationary front is affecting the
weather in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Mississippi with a cold front causing
thunderstorms in Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. Temperatures in the
50's dominated the Northeast with a low pressure system causing showers
and storms in the extreme Northeast. A cold front running through
Virgina, North Carolina, and South Carolina has caused severe
thunderstorms and a few tornadoes yesterday and today.<DD>
