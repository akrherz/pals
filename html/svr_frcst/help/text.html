<BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE">CAPE or Convective Available Potential Energy, is an important severe
weather variable, as it indicates to forecasters how much energy is available in
the atmosphere for storms to use.  Graphically, CAPE is the area between the temperature sounding
and the adiabatic line when it is warmer than the temperature sounding.  When forecasting severe weather, CAPE
values to look for should be greater than 1500 J/KG with seasonally large values
reaching above 3000 J/KG and sometimes even above 5000 J/KG !!
