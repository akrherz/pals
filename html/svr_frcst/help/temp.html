    <FONT SIZE="4">What does it mean when there is a sharp change in 
    temperature? For example, temperatures in Nebraska are in the 50s while 
    temperatures in Iowa are in the 70s.</FONT>
    <LI>
    <B><FONT SIZE="4">When there is a sharp change in temperature, it 
    generally indicates a front is in the area. In the above example, a 
    cold front is probably pushing into Iowa from Nebraska. Remember fronts 
    are a good lifting mechanism that cause storms to form.</FONT></B>

    <FONT SIZE="4">What does it mean when the wind barbs are pointing 
    towards each other?</FONT>
    <LI>
    <B><FONT SIZE="4">When wind barbs are pointing towards each other, 
    meteorologists say that convergence is occurring. This means that wind 
    is blowing towards each other from opposite directions and it has no 
    where to go but up. Upward motion is what causes clouds to form, and if 
    there is strong enough upward motion, storms may form.</FONT></B>
