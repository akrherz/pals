<BODY bgcolor="white">
A cap is a layer of warm air above the surface, seen best at
the 700mb to
850 mb layer.  Caps are important for severe weather because they allow large
instabilities to build up at the surface.  The SKEW T map below shows a good example of a cap,
 or a verticaltemperature inversion.  When the
temperature becomes warmer with height, an air parcel cannot rise until the
surface temperature has reached the convective temperature.  The convective
temperature is the temperature needed to "break the cap" so air parcels can
rise and possibly create large storms.  A cap is a good variable to look
for, because if the cap breaks, severe weather is usually a good
possibility.  Note: if a large cap breaks, instablility is usually very
strong and there is a good chance for severe weather, however, large caps are
hard to break, thus sunny skies will be prominent.
