Why is it important to look at the animation of the days events?      What can we
learn?</font color>
<br>
<br>
In order to understand what has happended throughout the day and how our
forecasts could be improved, it is importand to look at how and why the day's
events unfolded.  By looking at the animation, we can see how each surface field
changed throughout the day and what pattern(s) formed.  From this, we can look
for similar pattern(s) in future events which can in turn help us to better our
forecasts in the future.

For example, by looking at the moisture divergence animation on a summer day, we
can see how the moisture divergence field changes throughout the day, and how it
affects thunderstorm formation.  Or, by looking at the dew point field, we may
be able to see if thunderstorms formed on the leading edge of an influx in
moisture.

By looking at all of the surface field processes, we can see how all of them come
 together to produce our weather, or in this case, our severe weather.
