from the clouds. The level of intensity (dbz) is shown through various 
colors. The intensity scale is as follows</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">Radar returns indicate how strong a storm is by the 
reflectivity returned. Radar images can indicate different types of 
severe weather such as high wind producing storms, tornadoes, and 
extremely heavy rain. An example of a high wind producing storm would 
be a squall line. A squall line usually occurs just ahead of a cold 
front. It can be seen as a bunch of storms lined up next to each other 
and can be hundreds of miles long. This type of storm is known to 
produce high winds as it pushes through. Below is a picture of a squall 
line.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">A bow echo is a type of squall line where some of the 
storms have pushed ahead of the others giving the image a bowed out 
signature. This indicates extremely high winds are occurring at this 
time.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">The bow echo shown across Indiana shows how the storms 
have &quot;bowed out&quot;. This means that the winds have become 
stronger and are likely to be causing damage.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">Another radar image to look for is a hook echo. Hook 
echoes show a possible tornado due to the strong rotation of the storm. 
Here is an image of a hook echo from Spencer, South Dakota.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">The hook signature circled produced an F4 tornado in 
Spencer that day. Meteorologists look at storm cells for hooks because 
they show air flowing in to the storm. This is here an updraft is 
occurring or where air is moving up into the storm. It is near this 
updraft where tornadoes usually form.</FONT></P>

<UL>
    <LI>
    <FONT SIZE="5">When we look at radar images, how do we know which 
    storms will produce tornadoes, hail, or damaging winds?</FONT> 
    <LI>
    <B><FONT SIZE="5">When we look at a radar image and it shows a line 
    of storms next to each other or what is known as a squall line, it is a 
    safe bet that these storms are most likely causing damaging winds or 
    hail, but probably not tornadoes. Tornadoes usually form from supercell 
    storms that are usually isolated from other storms. These storms have 
    the ability to intake air from its surroundings and create strong 
    updrafts within the storm. Squall line storms cannot do this as they 
    would be pulling in rain cooled air from their neighboring storms, thus 
    inhibiting any chance of further development and would most likely 
    weaken the storm.</FONT></B>
