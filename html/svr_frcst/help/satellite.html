<FONT SIZE="4">This map is used by meteorologists to locate specific clouds that
are affecting the forecasting region.  In particular meterologists use the
satellite map to locate specific types of storms, such as squall lines or
supercells. An infrared satellite is a measure of the temperatures of the clouds
in the atmosphere.  The colder the cloud tops, the brighter they appear on the
image.  Meteorologists use the infrared satellites to locate clouds at night
when the sun falls beneath the horizon.</FONT>

<P>Above you can see the large clouds in northeast Kansas and northeast
Iowa.  These are
supercell thunderstorms.  They are easy to spot because they virtually explode
out of a clear sky.</P>

<P>In the image above you can see the long line of clouds through the Ohio
Valley and the lower Midwest.  This is
a squall line.  Squall lines usually form just ahead of a cold front and are usually
followed by clear sky to the west.</P>
