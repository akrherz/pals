<DD>By 18z, there are scattered showers in the northcentral plains and
the West coast. In the southern plains, there are showers and 
thunderstorms moving into Missouri Due to a warm front spanning from
Texas to a low pressure system in Colorado. Ahead of this front, we have
warm moist air being pumped in from the Gulf. We also have a
low pressure system moving into the west coast. The eastern US is
dominated by high pressure from the Ohio valley, eastward. </DD> <BR>
