<P><FONT size="4">Convergence or divergence is an accumulation or removal of air
at a point.  If convergence dominates,
air will accumulate, increasing the mass and cause the surface pressure to rise.    
This leads to the development of a high pressure system.  If divergence
dominates, air will leave the column thereby causing the
mass to decrease and the low pressure
can deepen.  An indicator of convergence and divergence is the direction change of height lines in the upper atmosphere.
 Height lines at the 200 mb level that come together is a signal of convergence.  
 If height lines at the 200 mb level are spreading apart, air molecules do
 not build up and divergence is implied.  </FONT></P>

<P>The preceding image is an example of convergence.  This is known by the squeezing of height lines over the Southwest United States.

<P>The above image is an example of divergence.  The height lines spread apart over the Plains from the bottom of the trough in the
Southwest United States.</P>
