<FONT SIZE="5">A front is the transition zone that separates air masses 
of contrasting temperatures. A front is a good mechanism for storm 
formation and a good indication of possible rough weather. When a front 
approaches, air is lifted upward creating instabiltiy in the 
atmosphere. Fronts can change many different variables including: 
temperature, dewpoint, wind direction and speed, pressure, and clouds.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">The cold front shown above illustrates how cold air, 
which is more dense than warm air, slides under the warm air which can 
cause lifting and storm formation.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">When a warm front approaches, warm air overides the 
colder air to produce thunderstorms and other cloud types shown below</FONT></P>

indicated by blue lines, while warm fronts are indicated by red lines.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="5">Stationary fronts are fronts which show little or no 
movement and are indicated by wind shifts on each side of the front.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="5">On the surface map, stationary fronts are indicated by a 
blue and red dotted line.</FONT></P>
<FONT SIZE="5">Occluded fronts are indicated by purple lines.  They are
fronts in which the cold front has caught up to the warm front and can
be a focus for severe weather.</FONT> <P>
