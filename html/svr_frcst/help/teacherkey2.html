<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>February 13, 2000</B></DT>

<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>April 20, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>The upper air maps show that the surface low from the previous
day has gained strength during the night.  The low moves out of the
Midwest and into the Ohio River Valley where a strong line of
thunderstorms form a squall line along the cold front.</DD> 
<BR> 
<DT><IMG SRC= "button.gif"><B>May 11, 2000</B></DT>

<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>May 30, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A low pressure system moves out of the western Plains and into
the Midwest where a stationary front develops in Nebraska and Iowa.  A low
level jet out of the southwest draws up temperatures in the 90`s into a
region where dew points are already in the 70`s.  This helps to trigger
thunderstorms and supercell thunderstorms in Iowa.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>June 3, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>An area of lower pressure moves out of the Plains and into the Midwest
causing thunderstorms and supercell thunderstorms to break out.  Also a
stationary front in Texas lights off some thunderstorms as well.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>June 11, 2000</B></DT>

occurs from Texas to North Dakota.  A second area of severe weather occurs
on a stationary front in the Northeast.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>June 12, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A surface low in southern Canada has a stationary front that stretches
from the northern Plains through the Ohio Valley and into the
Northeast.  Strong temperature and dew point gradients will help set off
storms along the frontal boundary and in the Midwest.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>June 13, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>An excellent squall line event.  A low pressure system in the upper
Midwest interacts with a warm, moist air mass.  A strong
squall line develops on the cold front as it moves east through MN to KS.  
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>June 15, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>An extensive cold front in the East is fed by southerly flow at the
surface and at the 850 mb level.  Showers and thunderstorms produce floods
and tornados from New England to the Southeast.  A low pressure system in
the upper Midwest is also fed by the southerly flow at both levels which
causes severe weather to erupt there as well.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>June 19, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A low pressure system builds in the Dakotas and moves east into a
warm, moist body of air in the Midwest. Thunderstorms are heaviest in the
Midwest with isolated storms in the Southeast.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>June 20, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A surface low deepens in the Midwest as it moves to the
northeast.  Definitive wind and dew point gradients clearly mark the warm
and the
cold front boundaries.  A squall line develops on the cold front and moves
into the central Midwest.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>July 5, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A stationary front across the country touches off many pockets of
showers and thunderstorms from the East coast to the central
Plains.  Temperatures on the south side of the front are in the 90`s to
iniate the thunderstorms.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>July 11, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A small disturbance moves into the upper Midwest causing thunderstorms
to develop in the Dakotas and move into Minnesota and Iowa.  A stationary
front from the Carolinas back west to Missouri also causes some
thunderstorms to light off.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>July 14, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A low pressure system moves out of the Midwest and into the Ohio
Valley where the state of Ohio gets hit hard with warnings for tornados,
flooding and severe thunderstorms.  Another, smaller surface low affects
the Southeast.  
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>July 16, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>This case is primarily an East coast and a Northeast event early in
the evening as a low slides up the coast.  In the late evening, a new area
of severe weather pops up in the central Plains along a dew point
gradient.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>July 18, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A cold front dives out of Canada and runs into a warmer, moister air
mass.  Thunderstorms develop from New England to the Midwest with
tornados in Illinois and Missouri.
</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button.gif"><B>July 22, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>A low pressure system moves into the Southeast and 
stretches cold fronts to the northeast and west where thunderstorms
develop
along.  Another disturbance in the central Rockies and central Plains
causes a severe weather breakout in Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska.
</DD>

<DT><IMG SRC="button2.gif"><B>January 19, 2000</B></DT>
<DD> A low develops in the Rockies and moves from Wyoming to southwest Iowa
giving central Iowa moderate snow fall amounts.</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button2.gif"><B>January 22, 2000</B></DT>

below freezing temperatures at the surface for many southeastern states.</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC="button2.gif"><B>January 25, 2000</B></DT>
<DD>  A very well developed "nor'easter" moves up the east coast dumping almost
<font color= red>2 feet of snow</font color= red> in the Carolinas and proceeding
 into New England with no signs of weakening.</DD>
<BR>  
<DT><IMG SRC= "button2.gif"><B>February 17, 2000</B></DT>

England.  Models did a good job.</DD> 
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC= "button2.gif"><B>December 11, 2000</B></DT>
<DD> A strong cyclone makes its way from the lee of the Rockies to the
Ohio Valley.  Large amounts of snow are dropped in the upper Midwest and
the Great Lakes.  High winds from the deepening low pressure kick up the
fresh snow and cause near white-out conditions in some areas.  Cold
temperatures are also associated with this system.</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC= "button2.gif"><B>December 18, 2000</B></DT>
<DD> A low pressure system pulls out of the Rockies and hits the upper
Midwest with its second major snowstorm in less than a week.  Heavy snow

Northeast.  Heavy snow is dropped from the Great Lakes to the eastern
seaboard.</DD>
<BR>
<DT><IMG SRC= "button2.gif"><B>March 22, 2001</B></DT>
<DD> A low pressure system moves from the mid-Atlantic region up the
Northeast coast in typical nor`easter fashion.  Large amounts of moisture
are pulled in from the Atlantic Ocean resulting in heavy snow from
Pennsylvania to Maine.</DD>
