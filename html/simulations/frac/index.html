<H1>Lesson Fractions</H1>

This lesson is designed for elementary school children learning
fractions for the first time.  It does not attempt to directly teach
fractions; rather, it simply provides students the opportunity to work
with and think about fractions.  It has not been rigorously tested and
may or may not be pedagogically sound, although it has shown promise
in several small pilot studies.  The major question is the ordering
and content of the exercises.  If you have suggestions, please let
me know.

Note: This was originally written as a stand-alone application and has
been slightly modified so it can be started as an applet.
