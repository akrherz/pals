</FONT><P>The origins of this simulation involved the desire to 
convert a standard introductory meteorology lecture course into one 
where constructivism was the main instructional model and students 
were expected to take a more active role in their own learning-all 
without reduction of class size. The course goals were expanded to 
include learning how to learn science as well as learning science 
content. One of the major tools used to accomplish this was the use 
of World Wide Web server software that manages Internet class 
activities. ClassNet, (Van Gorp and Boysen, 1997), was developed to 
accomplish this task (http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/).  This tool 
allowed every student to be an active participant in learning 
activities with easy access to course materials, enhanced 
communication with the instructor and other students, rapid feedback 
concerning assignment and exam scores, and ready access to their 
private records of course performance. </P>

<P>Course materials have been designed for introductory science 
courses at the secondary and college level.  They are intended to be 
supplemental to the course, allowing the instructor to decide which 
materials to use and which to omit.  Experience with these materials 
has shown that their effect, especially the effect of the simulations 
is gradual and sufficient time must be allowed to observe a 
difference in student behavior and attitude. At Iowa State University 
students often find the simulations to be uncomfortable at first 
because they use them before they hear the corresponding lectures, 
but this approach is deliberate and is intended to create questions 
in students' minds so they will come to class seeking answers.</P>

<P>It is recommended that part of class time be allotted to the use 
of Small Group Activities.  These allow students the opportunity to 
break away from the passive mode utilized in most large-scale classes 
and become more active learners.  These activities have been well 
received by students.  They often end up sitting in about the same 
place in the auditorium for every class meeting and usually look 
forward to interacting with the people who sit near them week after 
week.  Various collaborative activities are used to draw each student 
into the construction of hypotheses for explaining observed 
scientific phenomena or processes.  Lectures are then used to provide 
explanations when students have explored, tested and questioned 
various factors that relate to central course concepts.</P>

<P>Materials development for the new learning environment did not 
rely on traditional instructional development models.  The new 
materials could not be designed to simply teach the course content 
when the goal was to encourage the learner to explore, conjecture and 
test ideas.  The chosen solution was to develop problem-based 
simulations that pose scenarios and provide tools with which learners 
can explore, and that accurately reflect the results of specific 
learner's actions.  The materials have served to set the stage for 
further learning by revealing misconceptions, raising questions, 
activating relevant existing knowledge, and alerting the learner to 
the structure and utility of the material to be learned.</P>

</FONT><B><P>Description of BudgetSim Simulation</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>This activity was designed to simulate the energy intake of 
our atmosphere during the day and the loss of energy at all times. 
However, the principle of the rate of inputs balanced against outputs 
to determine the time rate of change for the parameter of interest is 
fundamental to any budget problem. For example, if spending is 
greater than saving the bank account will continue to drop and if 
energy resulting from food intake exceeds the use of energy during 
exercise periods weight gain will still occur. </P>

<P>In this activity, users can vary the intensity of the sun during 
the day. A tub of water fills up symbolically showing the energy 
intake of our atmosphere. The faucet is controlled by a timer and 
only fills the tub during a certain interval, just as the energy from 
the sun is an input only during daylight hours. A drain in the tub 
represents radiant energy loss that occurs all of the time. This is 
similar to energy that radiates continually from any body that has a 
temperature. </P>

<B><P>Instructional Goals</P>

</B><P>The use of BudgetSim supports two major goals.  It provides a 
semi-controlled opportunity for students to exercise skills in 
scientific reasoning and problem solving, and it serves as a 
foundation for understanding budget process.  For these goals to be 
met the instructor must take care in assigning the simulation and 
must follow the simulation experience with discussion of problem 
solving strategies.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Assigning BudgetSim</P>

</B><P>BudgetSim (Figure 1) is intended for use before rather than 
after any lecture on related topics.  Experience has shown, however, 
that the simulation should be previewed in class prior to asking the 
students to use it.  The operational features of the simulation 
should be demonstrated and the graphs and dials explained. However, 
students should not be told how to solve the problems.</P>

<P>It is recommended that students be advised to play with the 
simulation and then to complete the assigned tasks.  They should be 
strongly encouraged to make and test predictions as well as to try 
and explain the events they observe.  The following Problem Solving 
Strategy (or one similar to it) is recommended.</P>

<FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Simulation experience:</P>

<P>1. Explore the simulation, identifying the inputs, outputs and goals.</P>
<P>2. Estimate and note the expected outcomes.</P>
<P>3. Develop a plan to test these expectations.</P>
<P>4. Collect sufficient data and record results.</P>
<P>5. Analyze and summarize the data.</P>
<P>6. Compare and contrast the results with the expected results.</P>
<P>7. Question the reasonableness of the results and seek 
explanations for them.</P>
<P>8. Rethink the process, identifying additional data that needs to 
be collected and important questions that need to be resolved.</P>

<P>A general approach to help students learn to think as scientists 
think is to have them respond to questions similar to the 
following:</P>
<P>      What general patterns can you see in your observations? </P>
<P>      What might explain what you observed? </P>
<P>      What did you observe that you didn't expect? </P>
<P>      What factors are there that you can't explain? </P>

<P>The student responses can be used to generate discussion in class. </P>

</FONT><P>The container has a faucet for inflow and a drain for 
outflow. Water drains at a constant rate represented by a blue line 
on the bottom graph. At time t=0, water begins draining from the 
container, causing the level to drop. The lower graph records the 
rate of inflow of water from the faucet and the upper graph records 
the water level. </P>

<P>Task: A pump is on a timer that allows the faucet to work only 
after 6 and before 18 hours. After 6 hours of water draining out of 
the tub, the user will be allowed to control water flow into the tank 
by adjusting a faucet located above the tank. The slider below is 
used to control the rate of inflow. <B>The goal for the user is to 
adjust the faucet so that the maximum water level during the 24 hour 
period is 70" (±2").</B>  The inflow rate may be adjusted once every 
hour between the hours of t=6 and t=18. The graphs and tub diagram 
are provided to help visualizethe change in the water parameters at 
every hour. </P>

<B><P>Post-Simulation Activity</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</B></FONT><P>Following students' use of the simulation, it is 
recommended that students be assigned a small group activity of 
sharing strategies used with the simulation exercise and agreeing on 
a good strategy.  The teacher can solicit strategies from selected 
groups, outline one or two good approaches and discuss their merits. 
During this time the eight steps in the Problem Solving Strategy 
listed above can be presented and "methods" of meteorology can be 
described.  Experience has shown that special attention also needs to 
be given to interpretation of graphs and their use to represent 
relationships of this type.  The use of symbolic representation is a 
deficiency in many a student's knowledge base.</P>

<P>After the strategies have been covered, the results from the 
simulation can be shared.  Questions of reasonableness of the 
conclusions and scientific basis for these phenomena can be raised. 
Suggested questions that may be helpful in initiating discussion are 
listed below.  These questions should lead directly to a lecture on 
long and short wave radiation and their influence on the earth's 
temperature.</P>

<FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><B><P>Suggested Thought Questions for Class or Group Discussion</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Have a student do the BudgetSim during the class and determine:</P>
<P>1) At what time did the peak inflow from the faucet occur? </P>
<P>2) At what time did the peak water level in the tank occur? </P>
<P>3) Under what conditions of inflow and outflow did the water level 
increase?</P>
<P>Next ask the class to relate this to the balance of incoming solar 
radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation. When are they at their 
maximum values? What happens to the temperature of the 
earth/atmosphere when solar radiation exceeds outgoing terrestrial 
radiation? When are they equal? What time of day is temperature at a 
maximum? How is this related to the time when the solar input is 
greatest?</P>
