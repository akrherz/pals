<p>
These simulations were created at Iowa State University to support 
learning in a large-lecture introductory meteorology class. The 
development and application of these simulations have been reported 
at several conferences (e.g. Yarger et al, 1998, Hsu et al, 1998a,b), 
however, the proceedings are difficult to find. Thus three 
manuscripts are provided to support the use of these simulations.

        This applet simulates warm and cold air advection in the United States.  
        It allows users to vary wind speed and direction in Ames, Iowa. The 
        results show how the temperature gradient would change over a matter
        of time given the wind speed and direction.

        This applet simulates the energy intake of our atmosphere during the day and the lose of energy at
        night. Users can vary the intensity of the sun during the day. A tub of water fills up symbolically
        showing the energy intake of our atmosphere.

        This applet simulates the difficult concepts of adiabatic processes. A leaf symbolizes a parcel of air
        rising over the Mountain. Graphs then display the information as the leaf rises and falls. Users are
        allowed to vary the beginning temperature and vapor-pressure of the leaf.

        This applet simulates the differences of thermal exchange among four types of ground surfaces.
        Users can chose which land type they want to experiment with and then compare the results side-by-side in
        a graph.
