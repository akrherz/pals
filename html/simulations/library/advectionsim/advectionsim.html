This page shows a few of the options now available for AdvectionSim.  <BR>
<P>Some features are:
<UL>
<LI> Guessing of the final temperature is allowed with a running total of 
the number of correct guesses in a row.
<LI> Values for the spacing, direction, speed, etc. can be randomly selected 
by the computer. 
<LI> Some of the settings for speed, direction, duration, etc. can be 
specified as constant while others are randomly selected.
</UL>

<p>The applets may fail to appear initially in some browsers.  It may be
necessary to click on the "run" button.

The second applet has the gradient set to medium, duration set to 4 hours, 
wind speed set to 25, and randomly selects the direction for you.  It also
allows the user to guess the final Ames temperature.
