</FONT><P>The origins of this simulation involved the desire to 
convert a standard introductory meteorology lecture course into one 
where constructivism was the main instructional model and students 
were expected to take a more active role in their own learning-all 
without reduction of class size. The course goals were expanded to 
include learning how to learn science as well as learning science 
content. One of the major tools used to accomplish this was the use 
of World Wide Web server software that manages Internet class 
activities. ClassNet, (<FONT FACE="Times">Van Gorp and Boysen, 
1997),</FONT> was developed to accomplish this task 
(http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/).  This tool allowed every student 
to be an active participant in learning activities with easy access 
to course materials, enhanced communication with the instructor and 
other students, rapid feedback concerning assignment and exam scores, 
and ready access to their private records of course performance. </P>

<P>Course materials have been designed for introductory science 
courses at the secondary and college level.  They are intended to be 
supplemental to the course, allowing the instructor to decide which 
materials to use and which to omit.  Experience with these materials 
has shown that their effect, especially the effect of the simulations 
is gradual and sufficient time must be allowed to observe a 
difference in student behavior and attitude. At Iowa State University 
students often find the simulations to be uncomfortable at first 
because they use them before they hear the corresponding lectures, 
but this approach is deliberate and is intended to create questions 
in students' minds so they will come to class seeking answers.</P>

<P>It is recommended that part of class time be allotted to the use 
of Small Group Activities.  These allow students the opportunity to 
break away from the passive mode utilized in most large-scale classes 
and become more active learners.  These activities have been well 
received by students.  They often end up sitting in about the same 
place in the auditorium for every class meeting and usually look 
forward to interacting with the people who sit near them week after 
week.  Various collaborative activities are used to draw each student 
into the construction of hypotheses for explaining observed 
scientific phenomena or processes.  Lectures are then used to provide 
explanations when students have explored, tested and questioned 
various factors that relate to central course concepts.</P>

<P>Materials development for the new learning environment did not 
rely on traditional instructional development models.  The new 
materials could not be designed to simply teach the course content 
when the goal was to encourage the learner to explore, conjecture and 
test ideas.  The chosen solution was to develop problem-based 
simulations that pose scenarios and provide tools with which learners 
can explore, and that accurately reflect the results of specific 
learner's actions.  The materials have served to set the stage for 
further learning by revealing misconceptions, raising questions, 
activating relevant existing knowledge, and alerting the learner to 
the structure and utility of the material to be learned.</P>

<B><P>Description of AdvectionSim Simulation</P>

</B><P>Advection is the process by which a property of the atmosphere 
is transferred by the wind. When masses of air with warmer or colder 
temperatures replace air at a particular location, local temperatures 
will change to reflect this occurrence. The advection activity 
simulates temperature change by transport of warm and cold air masses 
by horizontal winds. Advection affects are important considerations 
when forecasting temperature change. This advection activity was 
constructed to aid students in learning how to predict temperature 
changes resulting from advection in a learning-by-doing format. This 
activity was originally developed to support a forecast exercise 
(Yarger et al., 2000) where users are required to determine whether 
or not advection will have a significant influence on temperature. 
Significance was defined by a temperature change of at least 1-degree 
Fahrenheit over a two-hour period. </P>

<P>Temperature advection is the change in temperature over time that 
results from the horizontal displacement of mass by the wind. The 
goal of this activity is to help students develop skills for 
determining how to quantify this quantity using data found on surface 
weather maps. The straightforward way is to compute it, however, 
there are several factors influencing this change and many students 
taking meteorology to meet a science requirement have minimal 
mathematics skill. Thus, several versions of AdvectionSim are 
provided to help students develop intuitive methods for estimating 
the rate of change of temperature resulting from advection. More 
advanced versions are discussed that encourage users to compute 
advection changes.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=4 COLOR="#008000">
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times"><P>Each activity simulates warm or cold 
air advection in the United States and allows users to select a from 
a range of temperature gradients and then observe how different wind 
speeds and directions affect the change in temperature in the 
vicinity of Ames, Iowa. The results show how the temperature would 
change during a selected time period for a particular wind speed and 
direction. </P>

<B><P>Instructional Goals</P>

</B><P>The first version (applet) of AdvectionSim is shown in Figure 
1. The slide bars are all under user control but the activity is 
passive in that the advection process in merely observed. Here the 
goal is to have the user experiment with the various factors that 
influence temperature change resulting from advection and observe the 
resulting temperature change. Students are expected to find that 
winds that blow from cold to warm result in temperature drops and 
winds from warm to cold give warmer conditions. They should also 
observe that not all winds result in temperature change. Because this 
version lets the user vary all the parameters it enables the user to 
vary only one at a time to see how different parameters affect the 
result. </P>

<P>In the second version (Figure 2) the user is allowed to select 
both the contour spacing and the wind direction and then guess the 
final temperature. The wind speed is always 25 knots and the duration 
of the event is always 4 hours. To help make this activity more 
challenging a score is kept that tells the user the number of 
successful correct guesses in a row. The instructional goal is to 
encourage users to test their skill for estimating temperature change 
until they can repeatedly predict the correct answer. An objective 
might be for students to get five predictions in a row before they 
are considered adequately proficient. This version engages the 
student more than version one since it requires that they make a 
prediction and then gives them feedback concerning the correct 
answer.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1 First version of AdvectionSim</P>

<P>The third version is similar to the second version but is more 
complicated in that all four variables are randomly selected. The 
user is still asked to predict the new temperature and the total 
number of correct answers in a row are also provided. The 
instructional goal is similar to that for the second version, to have 
the user demonstrate proficiency in predicting the influence of 
advection on temperature change by successfully predicting the 
correct temperature a predetermined number of times in a row. Another 
objective is to motivate the user to learn how to calculate this 
quantity since guessing is reasonably difficult when all four 
determining factors can change.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 2 Second version of AdvectionSim</P>

<P>The forth version can be skipped since it is the same as the third 
without the guessing. The fifth version is the same as the forth but 
now shows the formula. Because the program randomly selects all of 
the variables it is difficult to determine the correct final 
temperature without doing the calculations. However, now the formula 
is provided so that guessing is no longer necessary. The sixth 
version (Figure 3) also shows the formula but now the user may 
control each of the variables and enter the final temperature to see 
how many predictions they can make in a row. After a few trials they 
should become proficient enough so that determining the new 
temperature is no longer a challenge.</P>

<B><P>How to compute temperature advection</P>

</B><P>To compute advection, use the formula below. You will need to 
supply the values in the parentheses. Note that for our purposes, 1 
knot (a nautical mile per hour) is approximately equal to 1 mile per 
hour. To be precise one knot is equal to 1.15 miles per hour.</P>
<P>Temperature change = (wind speed miles/hour)*(direction 
factor)*(temperature gradient degrees/mile)*(duration in hours)</P>

<P>Use the following when determining the direction factor: </P>

<P> If angle between the wind barb and the contour is -&#9;use a 
Direction Factor of:</P>
<P>    &#9;90 degrees - 1</P>
<P>  &#9;45 degrees - 0.7&#9;</P>
<P>         &#9;  0 degrees - 0</P>
