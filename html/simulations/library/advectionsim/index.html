<P>
This page shows a few of the options now available for AdvectionSim.  <BR>
<P>Some features are:
<UL>
<LI> Guessing of the final temperature is allowed with a running total of 
the number of correct guesses in a row.

<LI> Values for the spacing, direction, speed, etc. can be randomly selected 
by the computer. 

<LI> Some of the settings for speed, direction, duration, etc. can be 
specified as constant while others are randomly selected.
</UL>


<p>The applets may fail to appear initially in some browsers.  It may be
necessary to click on the "run" button.

  <PARAM NAME="archive" VALUE="AdvectionSim.jar" />  
  <PARAM NAME="mode" VALUE="demo">
 
  Applet failed to run.  No Java plug-in was found.
</object>
</p>


<P>
The second applet has the gradient set to medium, duration set to 4 hours, 
wind speed set to 25, and randomly selects the direction for you.  It also
allows the user to guess the final Ames temperature.
