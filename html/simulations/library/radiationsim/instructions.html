</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>The origins of this simulation involved the desire to 
convert a standard introductory meteorology lecture course into one 
where constructivism was the main instructional model and students 
were expected to take a more active role in their own learning-all 
without reduction of class size. The course goals were expanded to 
include learning how to learn science as well as learning science 
content. One of the major tools used to accomplish this was the use 
of World Wide Web server software that manages Internet class 
activities. ClassNet, <FONT FACE="Times">Van Gorp and Boysen 
(1997),</FONT> was developed to accomplish this task 
(http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/).  This tool allowed every student 
to be an active participant in learning activities with easy access 
to course materials, enhanced communication with the instructor and 
other students, rapid feedback concerning assignment and exam scores, 
and ready access to their private records of course performance. </P>

<P>Course materials have been designed for introductory science 
courses at the secondary and college level.  They are intended to be 
supplemental to the course, allowing the instructor to decide which 
materials to use and which to omit.  Experience with these materials 
has shown that their effect, especially the effect of the 
simulations, is gradual and sufficient time must be allowed to 
observe a difference in student behavior and attitude. At Iowa State 
University students often find the simulations to be uncomfortable at 
first because they use them before they hear the corresponding 
lectures, but this approach is deliberate and is intended to create 
questions in students' minds so they will come to class seeking 
answers.</P>

<P>It is recommended that part of class time be allotted to the use 
of Small Group Activities.  These allow students the opportunity to 
break away from the passive mode utilized in most large-scale classes 
and become more active learners.  These activities have been well 
received by students.  They often end up sitting in about the same 
place in the auditorium for every class meeting and usually look 
forward to interacting with the people who sit near them week after 
week.  Various collaborative activities are used to draw each student 
into the construction of  hypotheses for explaining observed 
scientific phenomena or processes.  Lectures are then used to provide 
explanations when students have explored, tested and questioned 
various factors that relate to central course concepts.</P>

<P>Materials development for the new learning environment did not 
rely on traditional instructional development models.  The new 
materials could not be designed to simply teach the course content 
when the goal was to encourage the learner to explore, conjecture and 
test ideas.  The chosen solution was to develop problem-based 
simulations that pose scenarios and provide tools with which learners 
can explore, and that accurately reflect the results of specific 
learner's actions.  The materials have served to set the stage for 
further learning by revealing misconceptions, raising questions, 
activating relevant existing knowledge, and alerting the learner to 
the structure and utility of the material to be learned.</P>

</FONT><P>Description of the RadiationSim Simulation</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>RadiationSim (Figure 1) is a simulation of radiation 
processes in the earth's atmosphere caused by solar, terrestrial, and 
atmospheric radiation transfer.  Students analyze temperature data 
measured by a balloon (radiosonde) that they "launch" both in the 
morning and evening over four types of terrain (sand, plowed field, 
grass or fresh snow).  As the balloon is dragged and dropped to 
various heights in the simulated atmosphere, the temperatures at 
these altitudes are automatically plotted on a graph.  Several 
temperature profiles may be plotted concurrently to compare 
differences before clearing the graph.</P>

</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1.  RadiationSim</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>The students are asked to explore the various temperature 
profiles that can occur under different surface conditions and times 
of day.  Then they answer questions designed to test their 
understanding of the concepts experienced in the simulation. 
Specifically, the questions address the effects of ground cover, time 
of day and altitude on temperature.  </P>
<P>Students may use the simulation in any manner they feel necessary 
in order to answer the questions.</P>

<B><P>Instructional Goals</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</B></FONT><P>The Radiation Balance Simulation has two instructional 
goals.  First, it provides an environment in which beginning students 
can assume the role of scientist.  Second, if students reason beyond 
the data collected, the simulation raises some interesting "why" 
questions that lead to a much deeper understanding of long and short 
wave radiation.</P>

<P>For these goals to be met, the instructor must support the 
simulation by creating the proper initial environment, emphasizing 
the process of scientific discovery, and building higher level 
discussions on the student's RadiationSim experience.  Strategies for 
providing that support are discussed herein.</P>

<B><P>Assigning RadiationSim</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</B></FONT><P>This simulation is intended to be the initial simulated 
activity the students encounter in the meteorology course.  It is 
also intended to be a pre-lecture experience rather than a 
post-lecture practice assignment.  Experience has shown that this is 
a new type of learning endeavor for most students and much 
scaffolding needs to be provided.  The mechanics of the simulation 
should be demonstrated and some global strategies should be 
discussed.  It is most important, however, that the teacher's role 
not usurp the critical learning opportunities from the students.  The 
teacher's role can be seen more clearly if the learning goals are 
understood.</P>

<P>During this initial simulation the students should begin to 
develop a strong Problem Solving Strategy.  Most students are very 
weak in this area and need considerable encouragement in developing 
this skill.  An example of a Problem Solving Strategy that is the 
desired result from the use of RadiationSim is as follows:</P>

<P>1. Explore the simulation, identifying the inputs, outputs and goals.</P>
<P>2. Estimate and note the expected outcomes.</P>
<P>3. Develop a plan to test these expectations.</P>
<P>4. Collect sufficient data and record results.</P>
<P>5. Analyze and summarize the data.</P>
<P>6. Compare and contrast the results with the expected results.</P>
<P>7. Question the reasonableness of the results and seek 
explanations for them.</P>
<P>8. Rethink the process, identifying additional data that needs to 
be collected and important questions that need to be resolved.</P>

<P>With these expectations in mind, it is recommended that the 
teacher demonstrate the simulation by showing how to activate it, set 
the parameters, move the balloon, plot the points and read the graph. 
Students should then be challenged to "become a meteorologist" and 
make predictions about the relationships among ground cover, time of 
day, altitude and temperature.  </P>

<P>Students would be encouraged to develop a plan to test their 
expectations and, after using the simulation, reach a conclusion 
about the accuracy of their predictions.  At this point in the 
learning process, it is important for students to develop their own 
strategy to test their theories; the teacher will present the "ideal" 
Problem Solving Strategy only after students have generated one of 
their own.</P>

<B><P>Post-Simulation Activity</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</B></FONT><P>Following students' use of the simulation, it is 
recommended that students be assigned a small group activity of 
sharing strategies used with the simulation exercise and agreeing on 
a good strategy.  The teacher can solicit strategies from selected 
groups, outline one or two good approaches and discuss their merits. 
During this time the eight steps in the Problem Solving Strategy 
listed above can be presented and "methods" of meteorology can be 
described.  Experience has shown that special attention also needs to 
be given to interpretation of graphs and their use to represent 
relationships of this type.  The use of symbolic representation is a 
deficiency in many a student's knowledge base.</P>

<P>After the strategies have been covered, the results from the 
simulation can be shared.  Questions of reasonableness of the 
conclusions and scientific basis for these phenomena can be raised. 
Suggested questions that may be helpful in initiating discussion are 
listed below.  These questions should lead directly to a lecture on 
long and short wave radiation and their interaction with the earth's 
temperature.</P>

<B><P>Suggested Thought Questions for Class or Group Discussion</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</B></FONT><P>1. Of the four surfaces in RadiationSim (sand, plowed 
field, grass and snow), which one gets the hottest during the 
daytime?  The coldest?  Why?</P>
<P>2. How does temperature change with altitude?  How do the daytime 
air temperatures above each surface compare with nighttime?  How are 
they the same?  How are they different?  What causes the 
differences?</P>
<P>3. Focus on the temperature changes between 0 and 600 meters for 
all four surfaces.  As altitude increases in the daytime, what 
happens to the temperature?  What about nighttime?  What causes 
nighttime temperatures to increase below 600 meters?</P>
<P>4. What makes the earth warm?</P>
<P>5. What happens to the sun's energy after it strikes the earth? 
Where does it go?  Why doesn't the earth become progressively warmer 
with time?</P>
<P>6. If heat from the sun passes through the atmosphere on its way 
to the earth's surface, does this heat make the atmosphere as warm as 
the earth's surface?  Explain the reasons for your answer.</P>
<P>7. What change (if any) would there be in the average temperature 
of the earth's surface if there were no atmosphere?</P>

<B><P>Lecture Outline</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</B></FONT><P>I.    All objects (above absolute zero) emit radiation.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A. Higher temperature: the maximum emission of radiant energy 
occurs at shorter wavelengths (sun ~ 0.5um)</P>
<P>B. Lower temperature: the maximum emission of radiant energy 
occurs at longer wavelengths (earth ~ 10um)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>II.   Objects not only radiate energy, they absorb it as well.</P>
<P>A. Warming: (energy absorbed &gt; energy radiated)</P>
<P>B. Cooling: (energy absorbed &lt; energy radiated)</P>
<P>III.   Substances often interact with radiation in curious ways</P>
<P>A. The atmosphere absorbs some wavelengths and is transparent to 
others.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. It is largely transparent to visible radiation from the sun.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>2. It absorbs and re-emits certain wavelengths in the IR region. 
This helps warm the earth's surface and lower atmosphere.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>B. Clouds are also good absorbers at some wavelengths and poor 
absorbers at others.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. They are poor absorbers of visible solar radiation because they 
reflect much of the sunlight back into space.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>2. They are good absorbers and emitters of IR radiation from the 
earth.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>3. Thus, clouds tend to keep daytime temperatures lower and 
nighttime temperatures higher.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>IV.   An object that reflects a great deal of sunlight absorbs 
very little short-wave radiant energy.</P>
<P>A. Albedo: the reflectivity of a surface.</P>
<P>B. Objects that absorb radiation will heat up even if they are 
good emitters.</P>
<P>V.     Radiation exchange</P>
<P>A. The sun radiates short-wave energy to the earth.</P>
<P>B. The earth absorbs this solar energy and re-radiates it to the 
atmosphere as IR.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>C. The atmosphere absorbs IR energy from the earth and re-radiates 
it back to earth. </P>

</FONT><B><P>RadiationSim  Getting started</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>One of the first, and perhaps the most important, step in 
the Scientific Method is forming a hypothesis. This exercise will 
guide students through problem solving from the beginning (forming a 
hypothesis) to the end (testing and summarizing their results) and 
all of the steps in between. In Part 2 of this exercise, students 
will be asked to run a simulation, and observe and summarize their 
findings. </P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><B><P>Part 1 Forming a hypothesis</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>As demonstrated in class, this assignment allows you to 
collect your own temperature data at different heights in the 
atmosphere. Before beginning the simulation, please explain what you 
expect might happen. Consider the relationship of temperature and 
height and list any other variables you think might influence the 
temperature. Keep in mind that all hypotheses are not always 
necessarily "correct", but should exhibit considerable reasoning. You 
will be evaluated on the content of your hypothesis, rather than 
correctness.  Please be as detailed as possible. Your thoughts will 
help guide you through the simulation. Depending on the supporting 
class management tools available, a text entry box might be provided 
for student response. The instructor needs to devise a means for 
getting the student submissions for this initial step before a 
password is given to students that will permit then to begin the 
actual simulation. </P>

<B><P>Part 2 Introduction to the Radiation Simulation:</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Various meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, 
and wind) above the surface of the earth are measured using balloons 
(radiosondes) twice each day at specific locations. The balloons are 
launched just before 12UCT (6 AM CST in Iowa) and 00UCT (6 PM CST). 
Data for 6 AM reflect conditions from the previous night; the 6 PM 
values represent daytime conditions. During the fall of 1997, a 
narrow band of snow fell across the state of Iowa. The data in this 
simulation are based on this event using the snow and surrounding 
surface conditions. Students will examine the differing effects of 
the various surface conditions on temperature. They will be asked to 
explore and observe various environments for both day and night 
conditions. Then they will use their best judgement to tie their 
experiences into a coherent picture. After they have made their 
observations, they should be asked to describe their conclusions. </P>

<B><P>Directions:</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Drag the balloon in the simulation (see Figure 1) to 
various heights with the mouse. The height of the balloon (in meters) 
will be indicated. The temperatures corresponding to the various 
heights will be used to produce a vertical profile of temperature in 
the accompanying graph. Surface conditions and time of day will 
change the temperature profile. Compare the different profiles and 
record your general results for submission. Users may plot several 
profiles concurrently to compare differences before clearing the 
plot. </P>

<B><P>RadiationSim activity</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Summarize your observations. Some things you might want to 
consider, but are not limited to, include: </P>

<P>      What relationships did you find? What conclusions can be drawn? </P>
<P>      How did the surfaces you chose affect the temperature profile? </P>
<P>      What other variables came into play? </P>
<P>      How did your initial expectations compare with your findings? </P>
<P>      Do your conclusions seem reasonable? </P>
<P>      What unanswered questions were generated by your experience? </P>

<P>Please be as complete as possible. Your responses will be used to 
generate discussion in class. </P>
