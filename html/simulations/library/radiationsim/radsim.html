Radiation Simulation</h1></center>

<hr size=+1><font size=+2>Various meteorological parameters (temperature,
humidity, and wind) above the surface of the earth are measured using
balloons
(radiosondes) twice each day at specific locations. The balloons are
launched
just before 12Z (6 AM in Iowa) and 00Z (6 PM). Data for 6 AM reflect
conditions
from the previous night; the 6 PM values represent daytime
conditions.</font>
<p><font size=+2>During the fall of 1997, a narrow band of snow fell
across
the state of Iowa. The data in this simulation are based on this event
using the snow and surrounding surface conditions. We will examine the
differing effects of the various surface conditions on temperature.</font>
<p><font size=+2>You will be asked to explore and observe various
environments
for both day and night conditions. Then you will use your best judgement
to tie your own experiences into a coherent picture. We will use your
observations
during the following class periods to understand how these different
conditions
occurred.</font>
<h2>
<b>Directions:</b></h2>
<font size=+2>Drag the balloon in the following picture to various heights
with the mouse. The height of the balloon (in meters) will be indicated.
The temperatures corresponding to the various heights will be used to
produce
a vertical profile of temperature in the accompanying graph. Surface
conditions
and time of day will change the temperature profile. Compare the different
profiles and record your general results for submission. You may plot
several
profiles concurrently to compare differences before clearing the
plot.</font>
