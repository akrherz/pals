These simulations were created at Iowa State University to support 
learning in a large-lecture introductory meteorology class. The 
development and application of these simulations have been reported 
at several conferences (e.g. Yarger et al, 1998, Hsu et al, 1998a,b), 
however, the proceedings are difficult to find. Thus three 
manuscripts are provided to support the use of these simulations.
