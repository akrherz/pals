  <H3>Memops: An Introduction to Memory Operations</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>

An example of the <b>visible memory</b> is shown below: <br>

  <APPLET CODE="VisibleDemo.class" width=240 height=216></APPLET>
</CENTER>

<P>
In performing the exercises on the visible memory, you must use the <b>load</b>
command.  The command loads values into one location from another.
  
The <b>load</b> command shown below would <b>copy</b> the value which is in location
X[1] into location Z:
<pre>
  load z with x[1]
</pre>
Note carefully the form of the command.  Brackets <b>[ ]</b> and <b>spaces</b> are
important.  An <b>l</b> can be typed instead of the word <b>load</b> and a <b>w</b>
can be typed instead of the word <b>with</b>.

<P>
Here are a few more <b>examples</b> of the <b>load</b> command:
<pre>
  load x[2] with x[5]
  load x[3] with z
</pre>
Remember, you must press Return after typing a command to have it executed!
