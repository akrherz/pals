  <H1>Welcome To Memops</H1>
  <H2>An Introduction to Memory Operations</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>
This lesson enables you to use some important <b>computer concepts</b> before
they have been formally presented in class.  By exploring concepts in this
way, you should gain an intuitive understanding which will make formal
learning easier and more meaningful.

<P>
The lesson has two parts.  In both parts you will perform exercises in
a <b>model</b> of the <b>memory of a computer</b>.  In the first part, the
values stored in memory will be <b>visible</b>.  In the second part, the
values stored in memory will be <b>hidden</b> from view.

<P>
Commands are entered using the <b>editors</b> at the bottom of each page.
If letters you type do not appear in the editor, you need to click on the
editor with the mouse.

<P>
When you have typed a complete command, you must press <b>Return</b> to have
the command executed.

<P>
If you type an incorrect character, press <b>Backspace</b> to erase it.

<P>
When you have completed an exercise, click on the <b>Check</b> button on the
bottom of the page and the computer will evaluate your solution.  If your
solution is <b>correct</b>, proceed to the next exercise.  Otherwise,
<b>continue</b> the current exercise and click on the <b>Check</b> button
again when you think you have a correct solution.

<P>
You may need to <b>reset</b> the current exercise and start again with the
original values in the array.  To <b>reset</b> an exercise, click on the
<b>Reset</b> button located at the bottom of the page.

<P>
If you get stuck at any time, return to the the <b>preceding exercise</b>.
The <b>steps</b> required to solve the problems within one exercise are
frequently part of the solution to the next.

<P>
The solutions will <b>not</b> be given to you.  It is most important that you
<b>observe</b> the model carefully and <b>determine</b> how it works.

<P>
The <b>goal</b> is to get started <b>thinking about computers</b> and how they
work, not merely to solve these problems.

<P>
<b><u>Do the visible exercises first!</u></b> <br>
