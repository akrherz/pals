  <H3>Memops: An Introduction to Memory Operations</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>

An example of the <b>hidden memory</b> is shown below: 
<CENTER>
  <APPLET CODE="HiddenDemo.class" width=240 height=216></APPLET>
</CENTER>
The numeric values are only <b>covered</b> with the "###".
They are still there, you just can not see them.<br>

<P>
In performing the exercises on the hidden memory, you must use the
<b>compare</b> command in addition to the <b>load</b> command.
This command <b>compares</b> the value in one location with the value
in another location.
  
The <b>compare</b> command shown below would <b>compare</b> the value
in location X[1] to the value in location X[2]:
<pre>
  compare x[1] with x[2]
</pre>
Note carefully the form of the command.  Brackets <b>[ ]</b> and <b>spaces</b> are
important.  A <b>c</b> can be typed instead of the word <b>compare</b> and a 
<b>w</b> can be typed instead of the word <b>with</b>.

<P>
Here are a few more <b>examples</b> of the <b>compare</b> command:
<pre>
  compare x[2] with x[5]
  compare x[3] with z
</pre>
Remember, you must press Return after typing a command to have it executed!
