</FONT><P>The origins of this simulation involved the desire to 
convert a standard introductory meteorology lecture course into one 
where constructivism was the main instructional model and students 
were expected to take a more active role in their own learning-all 
without reduction of class size. The course goals were expanded to 
include learning how to learn science as well as learning science 
content.  One of the major tools used to accomplish this undertaking 
was the use of World Wide Web server software that manages Internet 
class activities. ClassNet, <FONT FACE="Times">Van Gorp and Boysen 
(1997),</FONT> was developed to accomplish this task 
(http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/).  This tool alloweds every student 
to be an active participant in learning activities with easy access 
to course materials, enhanced communication with the instructor and 
other students, rapid feedback concerning assignment and exam scores, 
and ready access to their private records of course performance. 
Course assignments involve authentic activities (forecasting), 
simulated learning environments (Java-based simulations) and more 
standard evaluations of content understanding (short-answer 
responses). </P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>The course goals have been expanded to include learning how 
to learn science as well as learning science content. The focus of 
the course is on the understanding of weather phenomena, and the 
primary vehicle for learning is an authentic activity where each 
student routinely predicts weather events and supports his or her 
prediction by identifying determining factors.  This weather 
forecasting activity has been very successful in encouraging student 
participation and in promoting understanding in this course.  The 
forecasts provide a continuing thread of meaningful discussion and 
motivation throughout the semester.</P>
<FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Course materials have been designed for introductory 
science courses at the secondary and college level.  They are 
intended to be supplemental to the course, allowing the instructor to 
decide which materials to use and which to omit.  Experience with 
these materials has shown that their effect, especially the effect of 
the simulations, is gradual and sufficient time must be allowed to 
observe a difference in student behavior and attitude. At Iowa State 
University sStudents often find the simulations to be uncomfortable 
at first because they use them before they hear the corresponding 
lectures, but this approach is deliberate and is intended to create 
questions in students' minds so they will come to class seeking 
answers.</P>

<P>It is recommended that pPart of class time should be allotted to 
the use of Small Group Activities.  These allow students the 
opportunity to break away from the passive mode utilized in most 
large-scale classes and become more active learners.  These 
activities have been well received by students.  They often end up 
sitting in about the same place in the auditorium for every class 
meeting and usually look forward to interacting with the people who 
sit near them week after week.  Various collaborative activities are 
used to draw each student into the construction of  hypotheses for 
explaining observed scientific phenomena or processes.  Lectures are 
then used to provide explanations when students have explored, tested 
and questioned various factors that relate to central course 
concepts.</P>

<P>Materials development for the new learning environment did not 
rely on traditional instructional development models.  The new 
materials could not be designed to simply teach the course content 
when the goal was to encourage the learner to explore, conjecture and 
test ideas.  The chosen solution was to develop problem-based 
simulations that pose scenariosand provide tools with which learners 
can explore, and that accurately reflect the results of specific 
learner's actions.  The materials have served to set the stage for 
further learning by revealing misconceptions, raising questions, 
activating relevant existing knowledge, and alerting the learner to 
the structure and utility of the material to be learned.</P>

</FONT><B><P>Description of the MountainSim Simulation</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>MountainSim (Figure 1) models the adiabatic process of a 
rising and  falling air mass.  An animated air mass, whose 
temperature and vapor pressure are displayed numerically and 
graphically, passes over a mountain.  The student's goal is either to 
cause precipitation at a given altitude or to produce a specified 
temperature increase when the air mass descends.  To reach these 
goals, the student must set the initial temperature and vapor 
pressure values for the air mass.  When set in motion, the simulation 
animates the air movement and any precipitation that occurs.  Two 
graphs are also displayed.  One graph plots temperature and vapor 
pressure for the air mass and the other shows temperature and 
altitude.  A notebook (use the View Log button) that records all 
trials is also provided.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P>A deep understanding of the simulation involves the ability 
to cause precipitation at a specified altitude, predict and produce 
temperature changes, and interpret and use the graphical 
representations.  Students who make use of the notebook are usually 
the most successful.</P>

<B><P>Instructional Goals</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>The use of MountainSim supports two major goals.  It 
provides a semi-controlled opportunity for students to exercise 
skills in scientific reasoning and problem solving, and it serves as 
a foundation for understanding adiabatic phenomena.  For these goals 
to be met the instructor must take care in assigning the simulation 
and must follow the simulation experience with discussion of problem 
solving strategies.</P>

<B><P>Assigning MountainSim</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>MountainSim is intended for use before rather than after 
any lecture on related topics.  Experience has shown, however, that 
the simulation should be previewed in class prior to asking the 
students to use it.  The operational features of the simulation 
should be demonstrated and the graphs and dials explained.  The 
permanent line on the vapor pressure vs. temperature graph should be 
identified as the vapor saturation curve.  However, students should 
not be told how to solve the problems.</P>

<P>It is recommended that students be advised to play with the 
simulation and then to complete the assigned tasks.  They should be 
strongly encouraged to make and test predictions as well as to try 
and explain the events they observe.  The following Problem Solving 
Strategy (or one similar to it) is recommended.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Simulation experience:</P>

<P>1. Explore the simulation, identifying the inputs, outputs and goals.</P>
<P>2. Estimate and note the expected outcomes.</P>
<P>3. Develop a plan to test these expectations.</P>
<P>4. Collect sufficient data and record results.</P>
<P>5. Analyze and summarize the data.</P>
<P>6. Compare and contrast the results with the expected results.</P>
<P>7. Question the reasonableness of the results and seek 
explanations for them.</P>
<P>8. Rethink the process, identifying additional data that needs to 
be collected and important questions that need to be resolved.</P>

<P>A general approach to help students learn to think as scientists 
think is to have them respond to questions similar to the 
following:</P>
<P>      What general patterns can you see in your observations? </P>
<P>      What might explain what you observed? </P>
<P>      What did you observe that you didn't expect? </P>
<P>      What factors are there that you can't explain? </P>

<P>The student responses can be used to generate discussion in class. </P>

</FONT><P>Introduction: A leaf as a marker (Figure 1) traces a wind 
blowing from left to right across the mountain. The initial 
conditions of the atmosphere at the base of the mountain on the left 
side are represented by the leaf placement on the vapor 
pressure/temperature graph. Use the slider controls to manipulate the 
initial conditions and run the simulation to answer the associated 
questions. Be patient, the simulation may take a while to load. You 
should see a picture of a mountain and two graphs. If you are having 
trouble viewing the simulation, you may need to click on the "Start 
Wind" button, or try another computer that is Java enabled. </P>

<P>Humidity emphasis questions:</P>

<P>1) Start with a vapor pressure of 10mb. Enter a temperature 
(between 0 C and 40 C) that will cause a cloud to form.</P>

<P>2) Start with a vapor pressure of 10mb. Enter a temperature 
(between 0 C and 40 C) that will not cause a cloud to form.</P>

<P>3) Given an initial air temperature of 28 C, enter an initial dew 
point temperature (between 0 C and 40 C) which will cause a cloud to 
form below 500m. </P>

<P>4) Given an initial air temperature of 28 C, enter an initial dew 
point temperature (between 0 C and 40 C) which will cause a cloud to 
form above 1000m.</P>

<P>5) Given an initial air temperature of 28 C, enter an initial dew 
point temperature (between -10 C and 40 C) which will cause no cloud 
to form.  </P>

<P>6) Given an initial air temperature of 20 C, enter an initial 
water vapor pressure (between 0 mb and 24 mb) which will cause 
instantaneous cloud formation.</P>

<P>7) Given an initial air temperature of 20 C, enter an initial 
water vapor pressure (between 0 mb and 24 mb) which will cause cloud 
formation above 1000m. </P>

<P>8) Given an initial air temperature of 20 C, enter an initial 
water vapor pressure (between 0 mb and 24 mb) which will cause no 
cloud formation. </P>

<P>Adiabatic process emphasis questions:</P>
<FONT FACE="Times" COLOR="#0000ff">
</FONT><P>A. Run the simulation for the default case (Temperature=25; 
Water Vapor Pressure=7; Dewpoint Temperature=2) and use this as a 
reference for future observations.</P>

<P>B. Next experiment with various initial positions of the leaf on 
the vapor pressure/temperature graph in order to achieve a desired 
5-5.5 degree Celsius difference between the initial and final 
temperature.</P>

<P>1) What would be a good strategy for finding the initial leaf 
position that caused the desired change?</P>
<P>2) How does the leaf path on the vapor pressure/temperature graph 
for the reference case compare with the path where the 5-5.5 degree 
Celsius temperature difference occurs? What do you think is 
happening?</P>
<P>3) How does the path on the altitude/temperature graph for the 
reference case compare with the path where the 5-5.5 degree C 
temperature difference occurs? Suggest a reason for the 
differences.</P>
<P>4) Watch both graphs simultaneously during conditions when a cloud 
forms. What relationship between the two curves do you observe?</P>
<P>5) In this simulation, rain falls each time a cloud appears. Often 
there are clouds present, but no rain. Hypothesize if a cloud formed 
but no rain fell, would you see the same temperature difference 
between the windward and leeward sides of the mountain? Why or why 
not?</P>

<P>During an in-class activity you may be asked to share what you 
noticed that is curious about these graphical representations.</P>

<B><P>Post-Simulation Activity</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><P>Following students' use of the simulation, the strategies 
for completing the tasks and the conclusions that were reached can be 
shared. A small group activity is a good method to </P>
<P>encourage students to share and justify their observations.  Some 
or all the following conclusions should result from group 
discussions:</P>

<P>1. The temperature of the air mass decreases as the air rises.</P>
<P>2. If the temperature decreases to a point on the vapor saturation 
curve, precipitation occurs.</P>
<P>3. Only if precipitation occurs is the final temperature of the 
air mass higher than the initial temperature.</P>
<P>4. The temperature vs. vapor pressure plot does not cross the 
vapor saturation curve.</P>
<P>5. For a given initial temperature, higher vapor pressures produce 
precipitation at lower altitudes.</P>
<P>6. The temperature of the air passing over the mountain changes at 
different rates depending on the occurrence of precipitation.</P>

<P>Group observations can lead to questions of why these phenomena 
occur and set the stage for the subsequent lecture.  The following 
thought questions may also be used to promote deeper thinking about 
the processes occurring in the simulation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times"><P>Suggested Thought Questions for Class or 
Group Discussion</P>
</B>
</FONT><P>1. If the simulation forms a cloud at a vapor pressure of 
10 mb and a given initial temperature, what change must be made in 
the initial temperature to prevent the formation of a cloud at 10 mb 
of pressure?  Why does this temperature change prevent the cloud from 
forming?</P>
<P>2. If the simulation forms a cloud at an air temperature of 20 C. 
and a given initial vapor pressure, what change must be made to the 
initial vapor pressure to MountainSim with humidity emphasis to 
prevent a cloud from forming at a temperature of 20 C.? Why does this 
vapor pressure change prevent the formation of a cloud?</P>
<P>3. What causes condensation? What changes in initial temperature 
and/or pressure would cause a cloud to form?  Give at least two 
answers.</P>
<P>4. Under what meteorological conditions would the temperature of 
an air mass decrease?</P>
<P>5. Under what meteorological conditions would the vapor pressure 
of an air mass increase?</P>

<P>MountainSim with advection emphasis:</P>

<P>1. Two air masses pass over identical mountains.  In one air mass 
precipitation occurs at the base of the mountain and continues to the 
top.  For the other air mass no precipitation occurs.  If the initial 
temperatures of the two air masses are the same, will their 
temperatures still be the same at the mountain peaks?  Explain your 
answer. </P>
<P>2. What about the temperatures of the two air masses when they 
descend to the bases of the mountains on the leeward side?  Will they 
be higher, lower or the same as their initial temperatures?</P>

<P>MountainSim with adiabatic processes emphasis:</P>

<P>1. Why does air cool when it rises but warm when it descends?</P>
<P>2. Why are there no clouds on the side of the mountain where the 
air descends?</P>
<P>3. What causes the temperature change from one side of the 
mountain to the other?</P>
