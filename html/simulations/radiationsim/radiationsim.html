Various meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, and wind) above
the surface of the earth are measured using balloons (radiosondes) twice
each day at specific locations. The balloons are launched just before 12Z
(6 AM in Iowa) and 00Z (6 PM). Data for 6 AM reflect conditions from the
previous night; the 6 PM values represent daytime conditions.

<P>During the fall of 1997, a narrow band of snow fell across the state
of Iowa. The data in this simulation are based on this event using the
snow and surrounding surface conditions. We will examine the differing
effects of the various surface conditions on temperature.

<P>You will be asked to explore and observe various environments for both
day and night conditions. Then you will use your best judgement to tie
your own experiences into a coherent picture. We will use your observations
during the following class periods to understand how these different conditions
occurred. There will be two parts to this activity. The first is described
below. The second will be completed later.
<H3>
Task:</H3>
For this activity, your task is to describe the effects of ground cover,
time of day, and altitude on temperature. To do this:
<OL>
<LI>
<B>explore</B> the simulation under various conditions and <B>observe</B>
the results</LI>

<LI>
<B>record</B> your conclusions on a piece of paper</LI>

<LI>
<B>complete </B>the exercise Rad_Sim_Part_1 on the assignments menu of
CLASSNET.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Enter</B> your conclusions about how ground cover, time of day, and
altitude effect temperature in the text box provided.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Submit</B> your assignment by clicking on the SUBMIT button in the <B>Rad_Sim_Part_1
assignment.</B></LI>
</OL>
Your observations will be used in class activities to understand how these
conditions occurred.
<H3>
Directions:</H3>
Drag the balloon in the following picture to various heights with the mouse.
The height of the balloon (in meters) will be indicated. The temperatures
corresponding to the various heights will be used to produce a vertical
profile of temperature in the accompanying graph. Surface conditions and
time of day will change the temperature profile. Compare the different
profiles and record your general results for submission. You may plot several
profiles concurrently to compare differences before clearing the plot.
