<p><b><u>Comparing an 850mb flow Index</u></b>
<p><b><u>To</u></b>
<p><b><u>Midwest Precipitation</u></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font size=-1>Since it is reasonable to say that most of the Midwest’s
precipitation comes from moisture that comes from the Gulf of Mexico, an
index meant to show the magnitude of meridional 850mb flow into/out of
the Gulf of Mexico was compared to precipitation in the Midwest. Below
is a description of the index, data acquisition and preliminary results.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Meridional flow is proportional to the height difference,
on a constant pressure surface, between points to the west and east of
the area in question. For example, to determine northerly/southerly 850mb
flow over the middle Gulf coast, an 850mb height observed along the gulf
coast of Texas would be subtracted from an 850mb height observed along
the gulf coast of Florida. Therefore, 850mb heights were collected for
the Tampa Bay, FL region and the Corpus Cristi, TX region and used to calculate
a 850mb flow index. The index is computed by subtracting the 850mb height
observed by Corpus Cristi from the 850mb height observed by Tampa Bay and
dividing by 30, which gives an index value that is usually between 2 and
-2.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Index = (Tampa</font></b><font size=-2>850 </font><b><font size=+1>–
Corpus</font></b><font size=-2>850</font><b><font size=+1>) / 30</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>Index values less than zero indicate northerly 850mb flow,
and values greater than zero indicate southerly 850mb flow. Because southerly
flow might bring moisture into the Midwest, an index value greater than
zero is expected to be connected to precipitation, and because northerly
flow would likely prevent moisture from the Gulf of Mexico from reaching
the Midwest, an index value less than zero is expected to be connected
to no precipitation.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The time period examined was 1961 to 1989. Arbitrarily,
only the 12Z times were gathered from the daily observations on the CDROM
<u>Radiosonde Data of North America 1946 – 1992 Version 1.0 August 1993</u>
produced by Forecast Systems Laboratory (Boulder, CO) and National Climatic
Data Center (Asheville, NC). From 1961 to June 1966, the Texas coast radiosonde
station used was Corpus Cristi, TX (NGP), then from July 1966 to November
1989 the station used was Victoria, TX (VCT), which is only 75 miles nne
of Corpus Cristi. From 1961 to June 1975, the Florida coast station used
was Tampa Bay, FL (TPA) and from July 1975 to 1989, the station used was
Tampa Bay/Ruskin, FL (TBW), which is only a few miles difference.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Hourly precipitation observations for the same period
mentioned above were gathered from the CDROM <u>Solar and Meteorological
Surface Observation Network (SAMSON) 1961 – 1990 Version 1.0 September
1993</u>. Stations used to represent the Midwest were the following: Waterloo,
IA (ALO), Des Moines, IA (DSM), Evansville, IN (EVV), Indianapolis, IN
(IND), Moline, IL (MLI), Madison, WI (MSN), Rochester, MN (RST), St. Louis,
MO (STL), Sioux City, IA (SUX), Topeka, KS (TOP), and from 1970 to 1989,
Columbia, MO (COU). The hourly data was then converted to daily totals.
Thus, the daily 850mb index could then be compared to the sum of the stations’
daily precipitation. Because frontal activity in spring and fall might
erratically influence precipitation amounts, June and December were selected
to compare an average daily index to the average daily precipitation for
a monthly period. In other words, the average June daily index was compared
to the average June daily precipitation from 1961 to 1989, and the average
December daily index was compared to the average December daily precipitation
from 1961 to 1989.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The average daily index for each June and December was
greater than zero with only one exception. For the December averages (Chart
1), if the index increased/decreased from one year to the next, the precipitation
also likely increased/decreased. The year with the highest December average
index occurred with the highest average daily precipitation. Also, two
of the three years with the lowest average index occurred with two of the
three years with the lowest average daily precipitation. For the June averages
(Chart 2) and for about half of the years, if the index increased/decreased
from one year to the next, the precipitation also increased/decreased.
The two years with the highest average June daily index could have their
validity questioned. One (June 1965) has only 16 days entered into its
average, and the other (June 1989) had a tropical storm influence the 850mb
heights at VCT. After omitting those two years, five of the next seven
years with the highest average daily index had average or above average
precipitation. The previous statement can also be applied to June 2000.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Upon comparing daily index values with daily precipitation
for some months, it was noticed that for up to 25 days the daily index
corresponds with the daily precipitation quite well. For examples, precipitation
would very often increase/decrease when the index increased/decreased,
and high precipitation often occurred when there was a high index for the
day. Sustained index values greater than or equal to one seemed to be a
good indicator of the Midwest getting precipitation for most of those particular
days. Related to the previous statement is when the 10day running average
of the June 2000 index was above one, the Midwest received above normal
precipitation (Chart 3). Sometimes when the index was below zero, precipitation
would occur if there was a moderate increase in the index even though it
stayed below zero. Other times, when the index was below zero for several
days and then went above zero for awhile, there would be a one or two day
lag for the precipitation to occur in the Midwest.</font>
