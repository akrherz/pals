"I was not exactly clear on the assignment, but here is what I think you might have been looking for. During the day, the temperatures were, on  average, four degrees higher than night time temperatures. However, that stated,  two surfaces were higher in temperature during the night than during the  day. These two were the plowed field and the fresh snow. I used different observation places from night to day time. This is where I am  unsure that I did the assignment correctly. Generally speaking, it was  true that during the day the temperatures went down as the balloon rose higher  in altitude.</UL></P>
