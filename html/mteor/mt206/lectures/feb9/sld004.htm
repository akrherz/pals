That tells me that the previous hypothesis was correct.  The puzzling part is that during the night, in the field as well as on the snow, the temperatures rose as the altitude got higher. My initial expectations were that as the altitude rose, the temperature would fall, and the day time temperatures would be warmer than during the night. I was correct  on both expectations, to my findings, but still confused about why the  temperature rose during the night in those two surfaces. Perhaps, there  were clouds which helped keep the air closer to the ground enforcing the  temperature during the night."
