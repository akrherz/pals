 <H1>Let’s consider why it is colder at the top of mountains.</H1> 
 <P><UL>
1. If the earth had no atmosphere the mean temperature at the surface would be about 250K (~9F).
</UL><UL>
2. When we add the  atmosphere the mean temperature at the surface increases to about 283K (~50F). The atmosphere radiates IR thus it contributes energy to the surface.
</UL><UL>
3. At the top of a mountain there is less atmosphere above to radiate IR so the temperature is lower than at the surface.
</UL><UL>
4. Death Valley is further below sea level than anywhere else in the U.S. Guess where the record hot temperatures are found? Why?</UL></P>
