 <H1>Apparently cooling the air involved in clouds is important</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>One cooling mechanism we learned about last period was adiabatic cooling. It is associated with rising air
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>When air rises it cools at 10 C/1000m when no drops (condensation) happens
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>It cools at ~ 6 C/1000m when drops are formed (condensation occurs and we see a cloud)</H2>
