           The most recent NCEP coupled model forecasts and statistical model forecasts, and other available forecasts exhibit considerable spread in the evolution of the SSTs over the next 3-9 months. The NCEP coupled model forecast  indicates that cold episode conditions will weaken during the next 3 months, followed by near-normal conditions           during June-November. The NCEP statistical model forecast shows a rapid transition to warm episode conditions over the next 9 months. Other available coupled model and statistical predictions indicate the continuation of cold episode  conditions through the end of 2000. The lack of any rapid evolution in the subsurface thermal structure and the           persistence of low-level easterly anomalies over the central and western equatorial Pacific continues to support a slower decay of the cold episode conditions than is shown by either the NCEP coupled model or the</UL></P>
