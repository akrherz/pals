In the right-hand plot of sea surface temperature anomalies, it is very easy to see El  Niño's, with water warmer than usual (red) in the eastern Pacific, during in  1986-1987, 1991-1992, 1993, 1994 and 1997-1998. Notice the very cool water  (blue), in the Eastern Pacific, in 1988-1989. This is a strong La Niña, which occurs  after some (but not all) El Niño years. 1995-1996 was a weaker La Niña year. It is unusual for El Niños to occur in such rapid succession, as has been the case during 1990-1994.
