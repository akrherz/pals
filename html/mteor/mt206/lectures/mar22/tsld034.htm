Santa Ana winds are named after the city of Santa Ana, southeast of Los Angeles. These winds are quite common during the autumn and
</UL><UL>
result from air moving across the Mojave Desert and then over and through passes in the San Gabriel, San Bernadino and San Jacinto
</UL><UL>
Mountains. Typically, a high-pressure air mass system positioned over the northwestern U.S. is responsible for this easterly flow. Clockwise
</UL><UL>
winds around this "high" move air from an east to west direction in the southwestern U.S. The air descending the mountains is extremely
</UL><UL>
warm and dry, and after blowing for a few days leads to widespread desiccation of trees and shrubs. It may only take a single bolt of
</UL><UL>
lightning or a careless camper to ignite thousands of acres. Once a fire begins, the Santa Ana winds are like a flame-thrower to the tinder-dry
</UL><UL>
vegetation. Thermal winds produced by the fires complement the force of the Santa Ana winds, making it very difficult to contain these
</UL><UL>
blazes, and everything in their path, including houses, may go up in flames in a matter of minutes. Wind gusts of over 70 mph and relative
</UL><UL>
humidity levels of 5% frequently occur during strong Santa Ana episodes. Source: NASA Science Question
