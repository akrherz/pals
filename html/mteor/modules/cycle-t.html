<BR><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Over the last three sections the 
development and decay of a non-severe thunderstorms has been explored. At this point
all three stages of the non-severe thunderstorm life cycle will be combined
into a composite animation. While viewing the animation think about the
processes described in the previous three sections. The
orange lines bow up during the early cumulus stage. This corresponds to
warm air rising inside the cloud. Notice that later these lines bow downward
as a result of cool air sinking within the cloud.</FONT> </BODY>
