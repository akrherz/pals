<BR><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bubbles of warm
air begin to develop close to the earth as the sunshine warms the surface.
These bubbles of warm air are called thermals. As they become buoyant (less
dense than the air above) they begin to rise. Therefore, vertical motions
become a factor. as the air begin to rise the pressure and temperature
begin to decrease with height. The thermals finally reach a point at which
they become saturated causing condensation to occur. On the animation this
occurs around the 1 kilometer (850 millibars) point, After this a cloud
begins to grow as the updrafts continue to force warm muggy air upward.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important
factor is that when condensation occurs more heat is released into the
atmosphere. This process continues to make the rising air more buoyant.
This added heat can be seen on the animation by watching the isotherms
(equal lines of temperature) bend upward as added heat being released due
to condensation occurs. At the zero degree line around 4 kilometers (600
millibars) another interesting ingredient comes into play. The formation
of ice crystals begin. This can be seen on the animation as light blue
droplets within the cloud. This process transforms the cumulus cloud into
a cumulonimbus cloud meaning the cloud is changing from a non-precipitating
cloud to a precipitating cloud.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary the
cumulus stage is dominated by updrafts in the atmosphere. During this stage
cumulus clouds form due to condensation and the process by which precipitation
forms gets underway. During the next section a continuation of development
will be displayed as we move into the Mature Stage of the thunderstorm
development.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099">&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; Important features
on the animation include:&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp; Orange lines- Isotherms (equal
lines of temperature), 2.) Numbers on the left hand side- Height of atmosphere
in kilometers, and 3.) Numbers on the right hand side- Height of atmosphere
in pressure.</FONT></FONT>
