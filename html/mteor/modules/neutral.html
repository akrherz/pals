<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This balloon sounding portrays
an atmosphere that is neither stable nor unstable.&nbsp; Thunderstorms
are rather unlikely in this situation although they are not out of the
question.&nbsp; A neutral atmosphere is present when the temperature of
a lifted parcel (bubble of air) is the same as the surrounding air temperature.&nbsp;
This can be seen on the balloon sounding.&nbsp; The air parcel path is
represented by the yellow line while the actual air temperature is represented
by the white line farthest to the right on the sounding.&nbsp; This sounding
shows the parcel temperature is almost the same as the actual air temperature
at any level, therefore its density is similar to the surrounding air.&nbsp;
These conditions will cause the lifted parcel to remain in its original
position.</FONT></H2>
