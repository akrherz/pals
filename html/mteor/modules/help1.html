COLOR="#3F66FF">The green curve represents the change of dew point 
temperature with height, the red curve shows
the actual temperature change with height, and the yellow dot 
creats a curve which shows the path of an air parcel. The first 
portion of the path in this example is dry adiabatic. If it is colder than 
the environmental air at these levels (to the left of the red sounding curve) 
it must be lifted by some forcing mechanism since it is more dense than 
the surrounding air. If the parcel is lifted until saturaiion is reached the 
air parcel will change temperature with height more slowly because latent heat is released. This 
difference in its lapse rate can cause it to eventually be warmer than 
the surrounding air. It will then be bouyant and rise on its own.

the temperature of air parcel is warmer than enrironmental air, the vertical
motion can occur without other forcing. If the rising air cools to saturation
cloud formation will result.</FONT></B></H2> </UL>
