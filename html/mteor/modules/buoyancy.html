<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section
explores the contribution that buoyancy plays in the role of thunderstorm
development.&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of buoyancy is credited to the Greek
mathematician Archimedes (287-212 BC).&nbsp;&nbsp; Archimedes found that
the weight a liquid displaced by a floating object is equal to the weight
of the body.&nbsp; This buoyant force results in objects which will sink
if they are heavier than the surrounding fluid and will rise if they are
lighter.&nbsp; If the object weighs the same as an equivalent volume of
the fluid, it will be in equilibrium and remain motionless.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In our case the object we will be discussing is an air parcel (bubble of
air) submersed in the atmosphere.&nbsp; To understand the motion of a parcel
with respect to the atmosphere we need to evaluate the density differences
between the surrounding air and the parcel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Density difference
are related to the temperature in the atmosphere.&nbsp; The colder (warmer)
an object is the more dense (less) it will be.&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; the
temperature differences between the atmosphere and the parcel is the determining
factor in whether the parcel will rise, fall, or stay at the same location
in the atmosphere.&nbsp; These three possibilities either increase the
chance of thunderstorms, decrease the the chance, or have little effect
on the chance, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>
