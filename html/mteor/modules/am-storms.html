SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-severe thunderstorms are the most common
type of thunderstorms across the United States. They mainly produce
showers with a few rumbles of thunder but rarely produce strong winds or
large hail. Most of the time they are very beneficial because of the rains
they produce. These systems on average are relatively short lived with an
average lifetime of around a 1/2 hour.&nbsp; As&nbsp; you watch the
animations corresponding to the stages in the birth and death of these
systems, see if you can identify how these storms can produce the
necessary lifting to start another thunderstorm nearby.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next three
sections will explore the life cycle of these thunderstorms by looking at
a vertical cross section of the atmosphere.&nbsp; The bottom of the cross
section is the surface of the earth while the top of the cross section is
approximately the upper region of the troposphere and lower region of the
stratosphere.&nbsp; Between these two regions (approx. 12 kilometers) 
thunderstorms develop. The cumulus stage proceeds to the mature stage. The
final stage is also known as the dissipation stage.</FONT></FONT>
