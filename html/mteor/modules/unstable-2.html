<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great Job!!!&nbsp; You selected the
sounding that is conducive to cloud development.&nbsp; An expert would
say that the balloon sounding corresponds to an atmosphere that is unstable.&nbsp;
Thunderstorms are very likely in this situation.&nbsp; An unstable atmosphere
is present when the temperature of a lifted parcel (bubble of air) is warmer
than the surrounding air temperature. This can be seen by comparing the
actual temperature profile (white line) with the path of the bubble or
parcel (yellow line).&nbsp; For this sounding the parcel temperature is
warmer than the actual air temperature at any level, therefore its density
is less than the surrounding air.&nbsp; These conditions will result in
bubbles of air rising in the atmosphere. Upward motions are responsible
for cloud formation.</FONT>
