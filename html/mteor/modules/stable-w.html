<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This balloon
sounding portrays an atmosphere that is stable. Thunderstorms are very
unlikely in this situation. A stable atmosphere is present when the temperature
of a lifted parcel (bubble of air) is less than the surrounding air temperature
(the balloon sounding). The air parcel path, represented by the yellow
line, is based on calculations while the actual air temperature is represented
by the white line farthest to the right on the sounding. A comparison of
the actual environment and the bubble temperature shows the parcel temperature
to be colder than the air temperature at any level, therefore the parcel
density is greater than the surrounding air. These conditions will cause
the displaced parcel to return to its original level rather than continuing
upward. Because upward motions are essential for the formation of clouds
with vertical extent, stable conditions throughout the atmosphere are not
conducive to thunderstorm development.</FONT></FONT>
