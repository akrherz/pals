<UL><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This balloon sounding would not be
the most conducive for cloud development.&nbsp; An expert would say that
this balloon sounding portrays an atmosphere that is neither stable nor
unstable. Thunderstorms are rather unlikely in this situation. A neutral
atmosphere is present when the temperature of a lifted parcel (bubble of
air) is the same as the surrounding air temperature at any height. The
temperature profile of the atmosphere from the balloon sounding and that
for the air parcel (bubble of air) are seen to be so similar that the lines
are nearly identical at all levels (the air parcel path is represented
by the yellow line while the actual air temperature is represented by the
white line on the sounding). Therefore the densities of the parcel and
the atmosphere in which it is embedded are also nearly the same. These
conditions will result in the lifted parcel remaining where it is put.</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1>
