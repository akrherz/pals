explores the role that drag plays in the life cycle of a thunderstorm.&nbsp;
Drag is a frictional force that is exerted on and by moving objects.&nbsp;
For our discussion we are concerned with the effect drag has on both the
raindrops and the surrounding air.&nbsp; As rain begins to fall the air
surrounding the raindrops act to slow the rate of decent.&nbsp; In this
process the surrounding air is pulled (dragged) downward by the falling
raindrops.&nbsp; This results in downward motion within the thunderstorm
which is called a downdraft.</FONT></FONT>
