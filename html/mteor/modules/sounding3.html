(A) is colder compared to that of the temperature of the environment&nbsp;
at the same&nbsp; level. It is then denser than the surrounding atmosphere,
and like a rock in water, will sink.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

(B) is warmer than the temperature of the environment&nbsp; at the same&nbsp;
level. It is then less dense than the surrounding atmosphere, and like
a cork held under water and released, will rise.&nbsp; It is less dense
than the surrounding atmosphere and is buoyant which results in upward
movement.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><INPUT name="choice" type="radio" value="3"

(C) is nearly equal to the temperature of the environment at the same&nbsp;
level. Since it has nearly the same density it is neutrally buoyant. This
means it will remain where it is put which results in neither upward nor
downward motion.</FONT>
