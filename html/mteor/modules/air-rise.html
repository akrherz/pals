<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data has been collected
for three different balloon soundings to give you an opportunity to test
your understanding of what atmospheric conditions are most likely to produce
thunderstorms. The curves displayed on the balloon sounding reflect vertical
changes of temperature and dew point.&nbsp; They represent different conditions
observed in the atmosphere which may be associated with the possibility
of thunderstorm development.&nbsp; Look at the three balloon soundings
below and select the one that would be most conducive to vertical motion
(which leads to cloud development).&nbsp; When the correct sounding is
selected you will be shown a quick-time movie displaying the formation
of a cloud.</FONT></FONT> <FONT SIZE=+1>Click directly on the balloon sounding
to select it as your answer.</FONT>

on the right) and dewpoint temperature (white line on the left) of the
atmosphere. The path of a rising air parcel is determined by a balance
between temperature and pressure adjustments inherent to the air parcel
(a complete explanation is left for a formal meteorology course). The parcel
path is indicated by the yellow line. For us, an air parcel is a possible
beginning of a cloud.&nbsp;</FONT></TD>
