<BR><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second stage
of thunderstorm development is often called the mature stage.&nbsp; During
this stage the thunderstorm&nbsp; is dominated by both updrafts and downdrafts
at different times.&nbsp; At the onset of this stage precipitation has
begun falling from the base of the cloud.&nbsp; Updrafts dominate as the
thunderstorm reaches its maximum potential in growth and intensity.&nbsp;
In the top center section of the animation the overshooting top can be
seen punching above the rest of the clouds.&nbsp; The overshooting top
is due to strong updrafts accelerating the cloud upward through the tropopause
(the top of the troposphere).&nbsp; In this upper region of the thunderstorm,
strong horizontal winds cause the cloud to be spread out horizontally forming
what is known as the anvil cloud. This occurs due to the cloud bumping
up against the stable stratosphere, the region just above the tropopause.
Eventually, downdrafts caused by the falling precipitation begin to dominate
the system.</FONT></FONT>

features on the animation include:&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp; Orange lines- Isotherms
(equal lines of temperature), 2.) Numbers on the left hand side- Height
of atmosphere in kilometers, and 3.) Numbers on the right hand side- Height
of atmosphere in pressure.</FONT></FONT>
