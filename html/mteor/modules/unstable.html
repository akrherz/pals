<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp; This balloon sounding portrays an atmosphere
that is unstable.&nbsp; Thunderstorms are very likely in this situation.&nbsp;
A unstable atmosphere is present when the temperature of a lifted parcel
(bubble of air) is greater than the surrounding air temperature.&nbsp;
This can be seen on the balloon sounding.&nbsp; The air parcel path is
represented by the yellow line while the actual air temperature is represented
by the white line farthest to the right on the sounding.&nbsp; This sounding
shows the parcel temperature is warmer than the actual air temperature
at any level, therefore its density is less than the surrounding air.&nbsp;
These conditions will cause the lifted parcel to rise in the atmosphere
to a new location.</FONT></H2>
