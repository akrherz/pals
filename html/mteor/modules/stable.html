<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This balloon sounding portrays
an atmosphere that is stable.&nbsp; Thunderstorms are very unlikely in
this situation.&nbsp; A stable atmosphere is present when the temperature
of a lifted parcel (bubble of air) is less than the surrounding air temperature.&nbsp;
This can be seen on the balloon sounding.&nbsp; The air parcel path is
represented by the yellow line while the actual air temperature is represented
by the white line farthest to the right on the sounding.&nbsp; This sounding
shows the parcel temperature is colder than the actual air temperature
at any level, therefore its density is greater than the surrounding air.&nbsp;
These conditions will cause the lifted parcel to sink.</FONT></H2>
