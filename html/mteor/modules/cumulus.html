<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; Bubbles of warm air begin to
develop close to the earth as the sunshine warms the surface. These bubbles
of warm air are called thermals. As they become buoyant (less dense than
the air above) they begin to rise. Therefore, vertical motions become a
factor. as the air begin to rise the pressure and temperature begin to
decrease with height. The thermals finally reach a point at which they
become saturated causing condensation to occur. On the animation this occurs
around the 1 kilometer (850 millibars) point, After this a cloud begins
to grow as the updrafts continue to force warm muggy air upward. <A HREF="#Picture1">Picture1 </A>gives a good indication of what is going on. Many puffy white clouds
can be seen spread across the sky. These clouds continue to grow higher
and higher with each surge of warm muggy air.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; Another important factor
is that when condensation occurs more heat is released into the atmosphere.
This process continues to make the rising air more buoyant. This added
heat can be seen on the animation by watching the isotherms (equal lines
of temperature) bend upward as added heat being released due to condensation
occurs. At the zero degree line around 4 kilometers (600 millibars) another
interesting ingredient comes into play. The formation of ice crystals begin.
This can be seen on the animation as light blue droplets within the cloud.
This process transforms the cumulus cloud into a cumulonimbus cloud meaning
the cloud is changing from a non-precipitating cloud to a precipitating
cloud.</FONT></FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>(<A

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary the cumulus
stage is dominated by updrafts in the atmosphere. During this stage cumulus
clouds form due to condensation and the process by which precipitation
forms gets underway. During the next section a continuation of development
will be displayed as we move into the Mature Stage of the thunderstorm
development.</FONT></FONT>
