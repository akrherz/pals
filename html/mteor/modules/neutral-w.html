<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This balloon sounding portrays a atmosphere
that is neither stable nor unstable. Thunderstorms are rather unlikely
in this situation. A neutral atmosphere is present when the temperature
of a lifted parcel (bubble of air) is the same as the surrounding air temperature.
The temperature profile of the atmosphere from the balloon sounding and
that for the air parcel (bubble of air) are seen to be so similar that
the lines are nearly identical at any level (the air parcel path is represented
by the yellow line while the actual air temperature is represented by the
white line farthest to the right on the sounding). Therefore the densities
are also nearly the same. These conditions will cause the lifted parcel
to remain where it is put.</FONT>
