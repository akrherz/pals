<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 3-D animation shows the further
development of a severe thunderstorm.&nbsp; Many of the factors we have
seen previously are brought together in this animation.&nbsp; Here we see
how the horizontal rotation created by the wind shear is transformed into
vertical rotation. This rotation is ultimately responsible for tornado
spin.&nbsp; Notice the role played by the updraft in changing the orientation
of the spin from a horizontal to a vertical axis.</FONT></FONT>
