<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last phase of
the thunderstorm life cycle is the dissipating stage.&nbsp; Falling precipitation
continues to strengthen the downdraft while quenching the updrafts, cutting
off the energy source of the thunderstorm.&nbsp; The precipitation weakens
as the cloud begins to evaporate. Evaporation further cools the air within
the thunderstorm enhancing the strength of the downdraft by making the
air denser (colder). This can be seen on the animation as the isotherms
(equal lines of temperature) bend downward in the center of the cloud.
By the end of this stage a major section of the cloud has either evaporated
or has spread out into the anvil. Precipitation is no longer being produced
and all that remains of the thunderstorm is a layer of high clouds.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Important features
on the animation include:&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp; Orange lines- Isotherms (equal
lines of temperature), 2.) Numbers on the left hand side- Height of atmosphere
in kilometers, and 3.) Numbers on the right hand side- Height of atmosphere
in pressure.</FONT></FONT>
